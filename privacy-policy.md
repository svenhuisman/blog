## Who we are

Our website address is https://svenhuisman.com

## What personal data we collect and why we collect it

### Comments

When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.

An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

### Media

If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.

### Contact forms

Our website uses Contact Form by BestWebSoft to collect basic personal data and the message you want to give us. This information is emailed to the administrator of this website and a back up is kept on the website. We will only use this data to contact you about the query you sent us.

### Cookies

If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to save your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.

### Embedded content from other websites

Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

### Analytics

We collect anonymous data using WP Statistics regarding the whereabouts of people visiting our website using your IP address. This information includes:

  * which country you are located in
  * which pages you have looked at
  * which search engine you used

We use this data to monitor our impact and improve the service we provide.

## Who we share your data with

We do not share data with third parties. The ads on svenhuisman.com are static ads without any interaction. They can not follow your move until you click on them, after which you are taken to their website.

## How long we retain your data

If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.

## What rights you have over your data

If you have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.

## Where we send your data

Visitor comments are checked through an automated spam detection service. The data retrieved there is only used for spam detection and never shared with anyone nor downloaded or handled in any other way.

## Your contact information

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us and we will take action.

  * By email: [info @ svenhuisman.com](mailto:info@svenhuisman.com)
