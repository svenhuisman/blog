<span style="Verdana;"><em>netBoot/i Scalability Demonstrated<br /> We are often asked about the scalability of our iSCSI boot solutions. To respond to these questions we’ve provided a general Capacity Planning Guidelines White Paper. One of our Premier Partners recently put these guidelines to the test in a live customer demonstration project – with impressive results. This diagram on our website presents an overview of the demonstration configuration consisting of:<br /> • 200+ Windows XP workstations<br /> • All workstations booting from a single shared iSCSI boot image<br /> • A single netBoot/i Server supporting all 200+ clients<br /> • A 10/100 mbps client network infrastructure<br /> In this case the customer was doing something that few others have attempted, so they insisted on a live demonstration to verify the scalability of netBoot/i in a shared boot environment. The demonstration was a great success and the customer is planning a deployment of over 1500 workstations in the coming year using an expanded version of this architecture.<br /> Another diagram further illustrating a similar generic shared boot-image configuration for Windows XP is available here. Please contact us if you’d like to learn more about the possibilities of shared iSCSI boot images and write-persistence. </em></span>
