As I was playing around with XenDesktop 4, I had some trouble connecting the Citrix Desktop Delivery Controller to the vCenter server. And as 95% of Xendesktop deployments are on VMware VI or vSphere, I thought this tip could be useful for you as wel. <!--more-->

What I was asked to do when creating a desktop group was to enter the vCenter Server address in the following format:

https://<vCenter server name>/sdk

(BTW, this address is case sensitive)

The Desktop Delivery Controller only accepts a trusted certificate and by default, that is not the case with vCenter&#8217;s SDK website. So you have 3 options:

  * import the certificate that is used with vCenter server on the Desktop Delivery Controller server.
  * Use a trusted certificate.
  * Enable HTTP on the SDK website.Â 

For test/demo environments you can use the last option, for production I would recommend the second option. Jarian Gibson wrote an <a title="xendesktop on vmware" href="https://jariangibson.com/2009/10/13/using-xendesktop-with-vmware/" target="_blank">article</a> that describes how to do this.
