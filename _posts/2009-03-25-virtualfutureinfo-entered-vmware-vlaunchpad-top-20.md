To my surprise I noticed that VirtualFuture.info is now in <a title="VMware-land" href="http://www.vmware-land.com" target="_blank">Eric Siebert</a>&#8216;s Top 20 of virtualization blogs on his <a title="vLaunchpad" href="http://vlp.vmware-land.com/" target="_blank">VMware vLaunchpad</a>! VirtualFuture.info entered at number 19, so there is still room for improvement ;-).

What I like especially about the VMware vLaunchpad is the vBar, where you can select the VMware documentation, admin tools and powershell scripts from a drop-down menu.
