Here is a nice video about using Powershell to execute a storage VMotion.



Ok it is a totally unsuported way because it uses a unsupported extention using a CTP version of Powershell. <!--more-->I downloaded the necessary software (Powershell CTP 2.0 and the Extensions) and got this to work myself. But I must admit it is pretty impressive and it shows the path where we&#8217;re going. And this is just the beginning.

I got this from the <a title="VI powershell blog" href="http://blogs.vmware.com/vipowershell/" target="_blank">VMware powershell blog</a>, it has a lot more powershell info.
