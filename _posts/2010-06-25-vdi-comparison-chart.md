When you enter &#8220;<a title="VDI comparison" href="https://www.google.com/#hl=en&q=vdi+comparison" target="_blank">VDI comparison</a>&#8221; in google, the first hit you get is actually one of my first blogpost I published 2 years ago. <a title="VDI comparison" href="https://svenhuisman.com/2008/06/vdi-comparison/" target="_blank">The blogpost</a> is about a VDI-broker feature comparison created by Quest. Although it was a useful document (to see which features Quest vWorkspace has), it wasn&#8217;t created by (an) independent person(s).  
It&#8217;s quit amazing to see that <a title="virtualfuture.info" href="https://svenhuisman.com" target="_blank">Virtualfuture.info</a> is still number 1 hit for &#8220;VDI comparison&#8221;. First of all because we didn&#8217;t create the comparison chart and second of all, since then, no one else created one. Until now!

<a title="Rspruijt" href="https://twitter.com/rspruijt" target="_blank">Ruben Spruijt</a> from <a title="PQR" href="https://www.pqr.com" target="_blank">PQR</a>, with the help of a number of colleagues (including me), created something more than just a feature comparison: the <a title="VDI Smackdown" href="https://virtuall.nl/download-document/vdi-smackdown" target="_blank">VDI smackdown whitepaper</a>!

> _In the current market there is an increasing demand for unbiased information about Desktop Virtualization solutions. This white paper is focused on solutions that are anticipated to have an important role in VDI deployments. An overview of available features of each solution is created to better understand each solutions capability._
