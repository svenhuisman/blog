Today Paul Maritz (VMware) in his keynote has used the name vSphere for the first time in public and told that the name will be official. Just to be clear : this name is not just VI4 or whatever you would call it but it&#8217;s the name for the next-gen products.

Besides that 2 new products were officially announced, details will follow later:

&#8211; vCenter Server Heartbeat (probably NeverFail technique)  
&#8211; VMware vShield Zones
