The following video gives a behind the scenes look of VMworldTV (in Dutch):



Unfortunately the Dutch VMUG TV crew doesn&#8217;t have 2 editors and people to handle the camera work, otherwise we could have done a lot more video&#8217;s :-). The VMworldTV did an excellent job this year, you should definately watch a couple of the video&#8217;s on their <a title="VMworldTV" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/vmworldtv" target="_blank">youtube-channel</a>. You can see the dutch VMUG TV video&#8217;s (most of them in English) also on <a title="Dutch VMUG TV" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/dutchvmug" target="_blank">youtube</a>.
