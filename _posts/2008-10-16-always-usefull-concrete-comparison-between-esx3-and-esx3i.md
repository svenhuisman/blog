**M**ost people who read our blog know something about virtualization so probably know what VMWare ESX and VMWare ESXi are. But <span class="entry-author-name">Alessandro Perilli</span> <a href="https://www.virtualization.info/2008/10/tech-vmware-esx-35-vs-exsi-35.html" target="_blank">pointed</a> the following KB article from VMWare out to me and I find it pretty usefull because it really clearly sums up the differences between the full ESX and the free ESXi product.
