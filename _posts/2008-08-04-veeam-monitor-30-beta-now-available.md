<a href="http://www.veeam.com" target="_blank">Veeam </a>just released the Veeam Monitor 3.0 beta which is used to monitor your VMWare Virtual Infrastructure environment.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">New features:</span>

&#8211; **Multiple new alarm sources**(VCenter events, VM Heartbeat, VM State and more)  
&#8211; **Alarm modeling & testing**(use your event history to see how Veeam Monitor reacts)  
&#8211; **Trend Reporting** (learn from your reports)<!--more-->

  
&#8211; **Better real-time monitoring graphs** (because of known VI events like snapshot creation, backup activities and so on)  
&#8211; **Alarm suppression** (finally !!!)  
&#8211; **VM monitoring** (monitor inside your VM)  
&#8211; **Console feature**(connect directly to the console of your VM from Veeam Monitor)
