<a title="VMware" href="http://www.vmware.com" target="_blank">VMware</a> will name the next release for their Virtual Infrastructure product VMware vSphere. At least that&#8217;s what Jason Boche says on <a title="Boche.net" href="http://www.boche.net/blog/?p=720" target="_blank">his blog</a>. VMware has not announced this publicly yet.

I knew that VMware was working on a new name for the next release of VI4 and that employees of VMware where able to vote for a name. So if you don&#8217;t like it, you have to blame them :-).

I&#8217;m kind of sad for all the bloggers, another name change. Citrix does this at least once a year (Metaframe to Presentation server to XenApp) and Microsoft also does this once in a while (Softgrid to App-V). Does this mean we as bloggers have to add tags to all other related posts or else google can&#8217;t find us? And for how long do we have to add the old name as a tag to new posts related to the old version? And why change the name at all? Scott Lowe has a good respond to that as <a title="Scott Lowe" href="http://blog.scottlowe.org/2008/12/19/get-used-to-vsphere/#comment-42885" target="_blank">a comment on his own article</a>.
