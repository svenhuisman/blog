I wanted to test the VMware View Offline desktop. I know it has some limitations at the moment and that it is still an experimental feature. But still, I wanted to be able to show a customer the capabilities that VMware View already has in the current release, whether it is an experimental feature or not. I managed to work around some of the limitations and in this post, I explain how.<!--more-->

According to the VMware <a title="VMware View Admin guide" href="http://www.vmware.com/pdf/viewmanager3_admin_guide.pdf" target="_blank">View admin guide</a> the current limitations for Offline desktop are:

  * <span style="color: #ff0000;">You cannot install View Client with Offline Desktop on any system that has the following applications installed:<br /> VMware ACE, VMware Player, VMware Server, VMware Workstation.</span>
  * <span style="color: #ff0000;">View Client with Offline desktop capabilities must be installed onÂ Windows XP Professional SP2 or SP3.</span>
  * Guest OS can only be Windows XP Professional SP2 or SP3.
  * Offline desktop can be used with: 
      * Individual, non-persistent, VM&#8217;s managed by Virtual Center
      * Automated, persistent, non-linked clone VM&#8217;s
      * Manual, persistent, VM&#8217;s managed by Virtual Center
  * <span style="color: #ff0000;">View Client with Offline Desktop cannot be run on a virtual machine.</span>
  * View Client with Offline Desktop does not support the use of smart cards.
  * You cannot download a desktop to a system where the guest exceeds the capabilities of the host; the host system must be at least as capable as the guest in order to run the View Manager desktop.
  * You cannot download a desktop if another user is currently logged in to that desktop.
  * ESX supports two simultaneous desktop checkouts. ESXi supports five simultaneous desktop checkouts.
  * Host CD?ROM redirection is not supported.
  * When a desktop is checked out, NAT is used for network communications.
  * The MAC address of the offline system remains the same as its online equivalent.
  * As with RDP, you can copy and paste text between host and guest systems. However, you cannot copy and paste system objects such as folders and files between systems.
  * Local drives are automatically mounted on the guest system.
  * Once a desktop is checked out on a client system, any changes made within View Administrator to the desktop or desktop pool settings will only be applied after the  
    desktop has been checked in again.

Â The limitations marked in RED where stopping me from testing out the Offline feature. as an IT-consultant, I have VMware Workstation on my notebook. So I couldn&#8217;t install the VMware View Client with offline desktop on my notebook. It does make sense, because the VMware View Client with Offline desktop contains a modified version of VMware player/ACE. So installing this while having another VMware product on my notebook could interfere with the View client. My colleague has Windows Vista on his notebook (the poor guy), so that wasn&#8217;t an option either. Final chance for me was to test it in a VirtualÂ Machine with XP. I couldn&#8217;t install it, because the installerÂ is aware of being installed on a VM.

Now here&#8217;s a crazy thought:Â why not use ThinApp toÂ virtualize the VMware View Client with Offline desktop? I&#8217;m probably going to run into some problems, because kernel-drivers are involved, but I decided to give it a go anyway.

I needed a physical Windows XP SP2/SP3 machine toÂ capture the installation of the VMware ViewÂ Client with OfflineÂ desktop. Luckily, IÂ recently installed XP on myÂ EEE PC (which I use at home), so I used it to ThinApp the View Client.Â My netbook isn&#8217;t a clean PC, which is recommended for using ThinApp, but hey, what I&#8217;m trying isn&#8217;t supported either ;-).

At this stage you might wonder why I didn&#8217;t use my EEE PC to test the Offline desktop feature. Good question&#8230; I guess I&#8217;m to lazy to bring it with me to the office, even if it is only 1 KG. ðŸ˜‰

Anyway, after capturing the VMware View Client (I did this last night at home), I tested the ThinApped version today at the office on my notebook, which has VMware Workstation on it. The client started, I could logon and the first thing to do is to check-out a virtual desktop:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="https://svenhuisman.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/view-offline.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1077" title="view-offline" src="https://svenhuisman.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/view-offline.jpg" alt="view-offline" width="373" height="275" srcset="https://svenhuisman.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/view-offline.jpg 414w, https://svenhuisman.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/view-offline-350x258.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 373px) 100vw, 373px" /></a>
</p>

That works! Now try it in a Virtual Machine with XP or Windows 2003&#8230; I can check-out a virtual desktop here as well! Great. Now wait until I can start it up&#8230;

First I tested the ThinApped Client in a Virtual Machine:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="https://svenhuisman.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/offline-error.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1083" title="offline-error" src="https://svenhuisman.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/offline-error.jpg" alt="offline-error" width="354" height="94" srcset="https://svenhuisman.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/offline-error.jpg 505w, https://svenhuisman.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/offline-error-350x92.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 354px) 100vw, 354px" /></a>
</p>

What I expected: &#8220;Unable to open kernel device&#8221;. Well, at least I can test the _Check-out_ and _Check-in_ feature.

Next, I tested it on my notebook, which has VMware workstation installed as well. To my surprise, the Offline desktop booted and I could logon to the Offline desktop:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="https://svenhuisman.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/offlineworks.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1084" title="offlineworks" src="https://svenhuisman.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/offlineworks.jpg" alt="offlineworks" width="265" height="196" srcset="https://svenhuisman.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/offlineworks.jpg 414w, https://svenhuisman.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/offlineworks-350x258.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 265px) 100vw, 265px" /></a>
</p>

I&#8217;m guessing the local installation of VMware Workstation has something to do with it, because the offline desktop uses a virtual NAT device and that is what comes with VMware Workstation. Also, when I stopped the NAT service of VMware Workstation, the offline desktop looses it&#8217;s network connection. So in the end, it all makes sense.

I haven&#8217;t tested it on Vista yet, but my guess is that if I install VMware Workstation, VMware Server, VMware player or VMware ACE first on Vista and then use the ThinApped version of the VMware View Client, I could probably use the offline feature as well.
