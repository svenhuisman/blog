Anyone with any interest in Virtualization has his or her personal reason to (want to) go to <a title="VMworld" href="http://www.vmworld2009.com/" target="_blank">VMworld</a> this year in San Fransisco. Unfortunately, the current economic situation, and a lot of companies cutting budget and even laying of employees, doesn&#8217;t allow a lot of people to actually go to this great event. Whether you are a system engineer who&#8217;s just starting to learn about virtualization, or a more experienced engineer, a consultant, maybe an IT manager or a sales manager or even a financial officer. You all can benefit from attending VMworld. But in the end, somewhere down the line, the guy who&#8217;s deciding if you can go or not, wants to know what&#8217;s in it for him and/or his company? &#8220;What&#8217;s the return on investment of you going to VMworld?&#8221;

And my answer is, as a good consultant ;-), it depends&#8230;<!--more-->

If you sit back during sessions and passively consume the information, you might as well get a <a title="VMworld subscription" href="http://www.vmworld.com/community/subscription/" target="_blank">subscription of the VMworld sessions</a>. It&#8217;s a lot cheaper and it saves you a trip to San Fransisco.

But if you are actively networking with other attendees, IT-professionals, VMware employees, share thoughts and experiences, attend labs, pick out the right sessions and talk to vendors on the solution exchange, you are definitely going home with a lot of ideas and (other peoples) experiences so you can say to your manager:

&#8211; &#8220;If we change the design this way, we can save more money on hardware, energy, rackspace, etc&#8221;  
&#8211; &#8220;We bether use product X to get our business critical applications a higher uptime&#8221;  
&#8211; &#8220;We should go for vendor B with our project because they have advantages Y and Z and it saves us $$ in X years time&#8221;  
&#8211; &#8220;I&#8217;ve talked to several other companies and they had the same problem but they solved it by using product D this and this way.&#8221;  
&#8211; &#8220;The problem we had with the HBA in our servers is solved. The VMware engineer logged in remotely and fixed it for us&#8221; (actually happens!)

I&#8217;ve attended VMworld a couple of times know and the interaction you get with other attendees, IT-professionals, VMware employees and on the solutions exchange is really priceless!

Hope to interact with you during VMworld this year!
