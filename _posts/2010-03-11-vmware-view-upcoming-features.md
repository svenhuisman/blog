Today I joined the <a title="VMware podcast" href="http://www.talkshoe.com/talkshoe/web/talkCast.jsp?masterId=19367" target="_blank">VMware communities podcast</a>. The topic of this podcast was VMware View and <a title="VDIInfo" href="http://www.twitter.com/VDIInfo" target="_blank">John Dodge</a> of VMware was on the phone. I&#8217;ve heard some interesting things today, which I think are worth sharing.

  * **Win7 support?** In the next release.<!--more-->

  * **Next minor or next major release?** Next release will be a major release.
  * Brand new UI for the View manager, more of an application but still a browser application.
  * **When RTO software integration?** RTO profiles integration in next release. Other RTO products will be released as seperate products.
  * VMware has been doing a lot of testing with the workload simulator (RAWC, available for VMware partners). Also IOPS testing. Results will be published in a new reference architecture whitepaper.
  * **View portal will be replaced** -> no more logon, only VMware View Client software download page.
  * Linux guests: not on roadmap yet.
  * **When first release on CVP (**<a title="CVP" href="http://www.vmware.com/company/news/releases/cvp-intel-vmworld.html" target="_blank"><strong>Client Virtualization Platform</strong></a>**)?** CVP has gotten a lower priority because, according to VMware, the community wants the offline desktop (a client hosted desktop). There is less demand for the CVP. A lot of the people in the podcast disagreed.
  * **Current planning of Offline desktop**: production ready in next release.

Just to get some numbers on &#8220;offline VDI&#8221; and to see if VMware is right not to give CVP a higher priority, here is a quick poll:
