Yesterday the new version of the RUNBook automation application RES Wisdom has been released! Why am I so happy with this release? It has some cool features for provisioning Virtual Machines, mailboxes, and users!

  What featuresÂ RES Wisdom already had and what new features have been added is shown in the picture below.
