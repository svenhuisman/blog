Last week I&#8217;ve been testing with the new version of XenApp (Formerly known as Presentation Server). First thing that different from the Technical Preview was the ease of installation on a Windows Server 2008. All components (except for Sun Java) install automatically. Next thing that&#8217;s a big difference is the occurance of the Web Interface, Black, very BlackÂ and very good looking.

I&#8217;ve createdÂ a dual mode streaming site to be able to test the new Isolation 3.0 features. Best improvement is <!--more-->the ability to link application profiles to each other. This way I don&#8217;t have to install Microsoft Office on all my Citrix Servers. I&#8217;ve linked my office profile to my visio profile and to my amazement I was able to create a visio object in my word document in a very smooth and quick way.

One pointÂ of comment is still the presense of two management consoles. I still have to create my policy&#8217;s in the XenApp Advanced Administration Console. Although these are settings that don&#8217;t change very often it would be nice if they were integrated in the Advanced Management Console aswell. Another point of comment is the installation procedure onÂ a Windows Server 2003. First install XenApp 4.5 and then Upgrade? Weird!!!!

Further on XenApp 5.0 is pretty much the same as XenApp (Presentation Server) 4.5.Â  A short list of first impression changes is:

&#8211; Change of the Web Interface theme

&#8211; Support forÂ Windows 2008 Server

&#8211; Linking Streamed Profiles

&#8211; Preferential Load Balancing (with two servers wasn&#8217;t it a very impressive testÂ ðŸ™‚ )

In the Platinum edition the new version of Edgesight is included aswell, the interface of this product has had a facelift aswell. This makes the tool more organised and easier to work with.

When I&#8217;ve worked with XenApp 5 in a bigger environment I&#8217;ll write a review of the product and can tell you more about perfomance in a live environment.
