We are currently updating our <a title="Application virtualization comparison chart" href="https://svenhuisman.com/2008/09/updated-application-virtualization-comparison-chart/" target="_blank">application virtualization comparison chart</a>. The one thing I&#8217;m most excited about is that we&#8217;ve added the launch times of a couple of applications you might want to virtualize. We have planned to release the updated chart this month, but I wanted to give you a sneak peak at the launch times of Adobe Acrobat 9.1 when virtualized with the featured products. In the chart you see the first launch and the second launch. The second launch is to see the difference when (some of the blocks of) the package is cached on disk or in memory. <!--more-->These results are to compare the products with each other under the same circumstances. In your own situation, you might get different results for each single product, but compared to each other you should see the same differences.

We&#8217;ve also tested Microsoft Word 2007 (as a part of an Enterprise suit package), Firefox, WinRAR and Microsoft Visio 2007 . In addition, we checked how much memory each virtual application consumes.
