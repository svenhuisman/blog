First of all: Happy new year and I wish you all a fantastic 2010! In this first post of the year on Virtualfuture, I want to bring the <a title="Favorite blogger" href="http://vsphere-land.com/news/time-to-vote-for-your-favorite-bloggers.html" target="_blank">latest survey of Eric Siebert&#8217;s top 25 &#8220;VMware and virtualization bloggers&#8221;</a> to your attention. Currently Virtualfuture.info is ranked at number 17, which I&#8217;m very proud of. I&#8217;m not saying I deserve to be in the new upcoming top 25 of Virtualization bloggers, but if you like what we&#8217;re doing, our <a title="Application virtualization comparison chart" href="https://svenhuisman.com/2009/09/application-virtualization-comparison-chart-september-2009/" target="_blank">Application virtualization comparison chart</a> for example or our event reports (VMworld, Synergy)Â and our regular blogging, please give Virtualfuture.info a <a title="Vote" href="http://www.surveygizmo.com/s/222837/pick-your-top-10-favorite-blogs" target="_blank">vote</a> as well.
