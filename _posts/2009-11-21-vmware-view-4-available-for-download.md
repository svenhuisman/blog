Yes, finally we can all find out ourselves if PCoIP is really as good as they say: <a title="View 4 download" href="https://downloads.vmware.com/d/info/desktop_downloads/vmware_view/4_0" target="_blank">View 4 is available for download</a>!

Here is all the information you need to get you started:

First, you need to upgrade your Virtual environment to one of the following:

  * <a title="vSphere Update 1" href="https://www.vmware.com/support/vsphere4/doc/vsp_esx40_u1_rel_notes.html" target="_blank">VMware vSphere 4 Update 1</a>. Update 1 is required (this update was released this week and includes VMware View 4.0, Windows 7 and Windows 2008 R2 support. Windows 7 is still a &#8220;technical preview&#8221; feature in View 4).
  * VMware Infrastructure 3.5. Update 3 or Update 4 is recommended. Update 5 is not supported.

Read the <a title="View 4 release notes" href="https://www.vmware.com/support/view40/doc/releasenotes_viewmanager40.html" target="_blank">release notes of VMware View 4</a>Â and the <a title="View 4 admin guide" href="https://www.vmware.com/pdf/view40_admin_guide.pdf" target="_blank">View 4 Admin guide</a>.

Install the View connection server, install a guest OS in a virtual machine (Windows 7 for example ðŸ™‚ ), install the View Agent into the guest OS, add the guest OS to the View Manager and you are ready to experience the new software PCoIP display protocol. Just install the View client and connect to the View manager server. Well, at least that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing now. ðŸ™‚
