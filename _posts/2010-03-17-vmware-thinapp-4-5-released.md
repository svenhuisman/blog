VMware announces the availability of <a title="ThinApp 4.5" href="https://www.vmware.com/products/thinapp/overview.html" target="_blank">ThinApp 4.5</a>:

> _VMware today announced the availability of VMware ThinApp 4.5, enabling rapid adoption of Microsoft Windows 7 in the enterprise by ensuring compatibility for legacy and custom applications across any Windows desktop operating system environment. ThinApp 4.5 enables enterprises to quickly migrate existing applications to new operating systems such as Microsoft Windows 7, eliminating conflicts between operating environments, and extending the life of application investments._

I was under the assumption ThinApp  4.5 was going to be released at the same time as the next release of VMware View, but  I guess I was wrong. Companies can now enjoy al the new features ThinApp 4.5 offers, such as:

**Full Support for Windows 7<!--more-->**

  
ThinApp now supports Windows 7. You can now package legacy applications from older versions of Windows such as Windows XP and Windows Vista into ThinApp packages for deployment on Windows 7. Avoid costly recoding and regression testing and accelerate deployment of business applications to Windows 7 more quickly and securely.

**Relink**  
If you’ve used previous versions of ThinApp to create application packages, these existing packages can be upgraded to the new ThinApp 4.5 format without the need of associated project files for the applications. This utility speeds up the upgrade process of existing ThinApp packages.

**Performance Accelerator**  
Reduced page file usage for virtual applications and increased memory sharing between multiple instances of applications allows for quicker application invocation and improved application delivery to end users. This helps to improve user experience with ThinApp at the same time reduces network bandwidth consumption.

**Registry Transaction Protection**  
Ensure the integrity of the registry file and eliminate potential data corruption due to crash or system failure by mapping to a backup registry file.
