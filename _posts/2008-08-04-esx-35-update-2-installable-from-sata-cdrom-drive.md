I haven&#8217;t tried it myself butÂ a costumer of mine told me that he installed ESX 3.5Update2 from a SATA CDROM drive, where previous he would have needed a normal ATAPI CDROM drive. This is great news for everyone who want to use / try ESX for a change. What a bit bothers me that I haven&#8217;t read this in any changelog so are there more undocumented features ?
