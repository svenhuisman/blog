I&#8217;ve created a whitepaper that describes <a title="ThinApp deployment whitepaper" href="https://svenhuisman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ThinApp-deployment-options_1.0.pdf" target="_blank">different kind of methods to deploy ThinApp applications</a>. ThinApp is often compared to other application virtualization solutions that have a deployment mechanism build-in, like Microsoft App-V or Citrix XenApp streaming. ThinApp doesn’t have a build-in deployment mechanism, but there are a lot of options to deploy ThinApp applications. This whitepaper will describe several methods to deploy ThinApp applications.

My plan is to include RES Workspace manager, Appsense, LiquidwareLabs Profile Unity and other methods to the whitepaper in the next couple of months. If you have any comment or suggestions, mail me or leave a comment.
