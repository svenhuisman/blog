I guess it&#8217;s <a title="VMworld Europe" href="http://www.vmworld.com/blogs/vmworld/2009/08/06/an-update-on-vmworld-europe" target="_blank">now official</a>: VMworld Europe won&#8217;t be held next February but we&#8217;ll have to wait until OctoberÂ 2010! The reason to do this is &#8220;_to ensure that we are able to roll out key initiatives to customers and partners more quickly and consistently worldwide_&#8220;, according to VMware.

For me as a blogger it won&#8217;t be interesting to go to the VMworld Europe event anymore because this time it really is going to be a &#8220;record-and-replay&#8221; event, so nothing new is going to be announced or demonstrated at the Europe event. I wonder if there won&#8217;t be any EMEA-partner sessions during VMworld 2010 in San Fransisco, because VMworld Europe will be held a month later&#8230;
