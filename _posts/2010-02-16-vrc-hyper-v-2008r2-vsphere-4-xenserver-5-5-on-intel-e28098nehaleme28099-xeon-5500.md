The &#8220;Project Virtual Reality Check&#8221; team just released a new whitepaper: &#8220;<a title="project VRC" href="http://www.projectvrc.nl/" target="_blank">Hyper-V 2008R2, vSphere 4, XenServer 5.5 on Intel ‘Nehalem’ Xeon 5500</a>&#8220;. 

> <div>
>   <em><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span>&#8220;If you are looking for an independent advise and a ‘Reality Check’ in relation to Virtualizing Terminal Server and Desktop workloads, if you are curious about the impact of different hypervisors and the performance differences with various hardware and if you are searching for best practices for your virtual Desktops … Project VRC whitepapers are a must read!&#8221;</em>

  The whitepaper contains: 
</div>

  * Highlights, performance differences and best practice conclusions for Terminal Services workloads on: 
      * Bare metal Terminal Services; 2003/2008/x86/x64
      * Hypervisors: Citrix  XenServer 5.5, Microsoft Windows Server 2008R2 ‘Hyper-V’ and VMware vSphere 4.0
      * Performance impact using different HP Proliant state-of-the-art hardware using Intel Xeon ‘Nehalem’ x5500 <!--more-->

Project VRC is an independent research joint venture between two companies: <a href="http://www.loginconsultants.nl/" target="_blank">Login Consultants</a> and [PQR](http://www.pqr.nl/). This unbiased and independent R&D project started early 2009. All together more than 450 tests were carried out (Q1-2010), the results are published and are free available on [www.virtualrealitycheck.net](http://www.virtualrealitycheck.net/). The goal of Project VRC is to analyze the developments in the Application- and Desktop Virtualization marked and present the results in a unbiased and independent way.

As for the results in this whitepaper, don&#8221;t just look at the graphs but read the entire whitepaper.
