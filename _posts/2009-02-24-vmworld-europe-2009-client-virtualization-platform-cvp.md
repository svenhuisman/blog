Today VMware announced new collaboration with Intel Corporation to deliver the VMware Client Virtualization Platform (CVP) as a new product that will be part of the VMware View suite of desktop virtualization products. According to the <a title="CVP" href="http://www.vmware.com/company/news/releases/cvp-intel-vmworld.html" target="_blank">press-release</a>, the upcoming Client Hypervisor requires Intel vPro:

> _VMware CVP is a bare-metal client hypervisor optimized to run on desktop and notebook client PCs utilizing Intel® Core®2 and Centrino® 2 processors with Intel® vPro™ technology. CVP will extend the centralized management capabilities of VMware View by enabling end users to run their virtualized desktop environments on desktop or notebook PCs and work online or offline while IT administrators manage these environments securely from a central location. This helps customers further reduce the operating costs of PC management while boosting business flexibility and end user productivity._
