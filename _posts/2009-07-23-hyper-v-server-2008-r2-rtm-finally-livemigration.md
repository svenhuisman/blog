Check out an extensive, _Microsoft flavored_, review of both products and it&#8217;s new features on <a href="https://blogs.technet.com/virtualization/archive/2009/07/22/windows-server-2008-r2-hyper-v-server-2008-r2-rtm.aspx " target="_blank">this page at the Windows Virtualization Team Blog</a>.

By releasing R2 with <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">V-Motion</span>LiveMigration Microsoft finally has listened to their customers and thereby makes their product more &#8220;_Enterprise Ready_&#8220;. With their slogan &#8220;_We believe everyone should have access to high performance hypervisor based virtualization. Period._&#8221; they are hoping to make a giant leap in virtualization market share.

Although that this is just a small feature wich only add&#8217;s a little bit to the &#8220;_Enterprise readiness_&#8220;, I suspect that customers will welcome this as the holey missing grail and start accepting Hyper-V as a mature hardware virtualization product.

I can&#8217;t find a release date for SCVMM R2 yet but <a href="https://blogs.technet.com/rakeshm/archive/2009/07/13/scvmm-2008-r2-release-date-information.aspx" target="_blank">according to Rakesh</a> from MS it&#8217;ll be really soon after the release of Hyper-V/W2K8 R2. Only then we&#8217;ll be able to release the full potential.
