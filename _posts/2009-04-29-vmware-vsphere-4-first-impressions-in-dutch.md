Viktor over at the Dutch VMUG site posted the first part of his <a title="VMware vSphere 4 review" href="http://www.vmug.nl/cms/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=66:vsphere-4-eerste-ervaringen&catid=16:vsphere-4&Itemid=13" target="_blank">first impressions of VMware vSphere 4</a>. This &#8220;review&#8221; is in Dutch so maybe not interesting for all of you, but it has a lot of screenshots of VMware vSphere 4. Viktor writes about his experiences during the first &#8220;What&#8217;s New in VMware vSphere 4&#8221; training he teaches at XTG.
