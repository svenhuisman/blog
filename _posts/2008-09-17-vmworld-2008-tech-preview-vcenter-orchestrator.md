vCenter Orchestrator is part of the management vServices. This will be available (suprise suprise) next year.  
What you can do with this is drag-and-drop development of customized workflows to automate operational task.  
Examples of what you can do with this are:<!--more-->

  
Provisioning  
 &#8211; automate builds of ESX and VMs  
 &#8211; Provisioning storage and network related devices relating to virtual infrastructure

Managing applications and operating systems  
 &#8211; automating appl installation and basic configuration

maintenance and a bit of DR  
 &#8211; creating or moving VMs during maintenance  
 &#8211; pre-provisioning of VMs

Backup and decommissioning  
 &#8211; managing archives, backups, and snapshots of VMs

I recorded the demo that was shown. It was actually pretty funny, because what he created was a workflow to do a quick migration of a virtual machine. So what Microsoft is doing with Hyper-V now, an administrator can create an automated workflow with Orchestrator in less then 5 minutes.
