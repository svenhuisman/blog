It really comes close now, what I mean is VMworld is really getting close and the expectations are growing, at least as far as I&#8217;m concerned. We landed in Las Vegas last friday after a long flight, did a walk up and down the strip, walked through several casino&#8217;s and we were overwhelmed by the shear over the topness of Las Vegas. Every thing is so out of bounds. We did a check on the Venetian, which seems larger than expected.

For everyone who is coming to the convention you can spot us through our polo&#8217;s we are wearing, mentioned in an earlier blog by Sven. We are going to hand over the prize winning shirts to Tim for his &#8220;You Never Forget your first P2V&#8221; and  Scott for his &#8220;Be Wiser, use a Hypervisor&#8221; our fellow blogger Matthijs will hand over the polo to Rob for his &#8220;Real Men use Real Hypervisors&#8221;. If you spot and approach us you might get your very own polo with the VirtualFuture logo on it (we have a few extra).<img class="size-medium wp-image-307 aligncenter" src="https://svenhuisman.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/img_4132.jpg" alt="Polos" width="391" height="292" />
