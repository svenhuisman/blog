**If unofficially began yesterday** with picking up the badges, grabbing something to eat, meeting up with Mike Laverick, Scott Herald, Scott Bennet and some other established names in the VMware Community. Later on a real spontaneous unofficial Dutch VMUG “borrel” by **<a href="http://twitter.com/viktoriousss" target="_blank">Viktorious</a>** (head of the Dutch VMUG):<!--more-->

**It off course officially began** today with a Super Session with multiple speakers with, among others, Paul Maritz. It was Partner Day so it was basically a session with loads of info about numbers, growth, market shifting and how important we, as partners, are for VMware. All true and usefull but a bit to American for my style. They are great speakers though !

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The most important message was that we see IT as a Service in a new stack</span>:

&#8211; **Cloud infrastructure management** ( vSphere, vCenter, vCloud Director, vShield)  
&#8211; **Cloud application platform** (Spring, vFabric, Hyperic)  
&#8211; **End-user computing** (View, Thinapp, Zimbra)

I think at least 90%, probably all, of the sessions will dive deeper into these products and concepts so you’ll definitely hear more about that.

I personally used today to get some lab time with ThinApp 4.6, View 4.5 and vCloud Director. The last one was interesting; it seems to encapsulate most of the LabManager features but is a brandnew product designed completely for hybrid Cloud Management (Private and Public Clouds); looks like a pretty mature product already!

What I also found impressive was that the labs are all hosted in the cloud (<a href="http://www.terremark.com/services/cloudcomputing/theenterprisecloud.aspx" target="_blank">Terramark</a> and <a href="http://www.verizonbusiness.com/" target="_blank">Verizon</a> in the states)  and with &#8220;only&#8221; a 48 mbit line it worked pretty smoothly!

All and all a great start for VMworld and I&#8217;m looking forward to the openening KeyNote tomorrow morning !
