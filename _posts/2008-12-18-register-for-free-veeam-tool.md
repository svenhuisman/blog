If you work for NASA and just returned from your trip to the moon (I don&#8217;t know how else you could have missed this news, Veeam marketing is doing a great job!), you definitely want to <a title="Free tool" href="https://www.veeam.com/xmas/default.html" target="_blank">register</a> for the free tool for VMware admins that Veeam is giving away on December 22nd. (If you actually work for NASA, you probably don&#8217;t need this tool). 

I just read on <a title="Boche.net" href="https://www.boche.net/blog/?p=716" target="_blank">Jason Boche&#8217;s blog</a> he was able to take a look under <a title="Rich Brambley" href="https://vmetc.com/2008/12/12/guess-what-free-tool-from-veeam-will-be-available-on-dec-22/" target="_blank">Rich Brambley&#8217;s Chrismas tree</a> and unwrapped the present <a title="Veeam" href="https://www.veeam.com" target="_blank">Veeam</a> left behind a little more. If the tool is as good as the marketing team, this is really a must have! Go <a title="Free tool" href="https://www.veeam.com/xmas/default.html" target="_blank">register now</a>!
