Yeah Finally it happened! Yesterday at the CCIA, CCEA happy hour Citrix announced the coming of two new upgrade paths for CCEA and CCIA. In the past you had t take all new exams to hold you status now for the CCEA you&#8217;ll only have to take on exam to upgrade to XenApp 5 en for the CCIA two exams will be required (which is a lot better than 7 ;)).

Additionally I spoke to Kpayah Tamba he&#8217;s one of the seniorÂ developers op new citrix exams and he promissed me all new exams will be like the XenDesktop, XenServer and Xenapp exams. This means they are more focused on the usage of the product instead of asking facts you can look up (like which port number is used for&#8230; although some CCEA I know still think 2598 is the ICA port;))

Later on I spoke to Julieann Scalisi who is Managing Director Worldwide education, and she told me the course for XenApp Advanced administration remains a requirement for the CCAA certification, in addition sheÂ told me this course will even learn the biggest Citrix Cracks new things. So I invitedÂ her to join me on a course in ford lauderdale and she accepted ðŸ™‚

By the way I&#8217;ve been interviewed for Citrix TV regarding Citrix Education, I will post the link as soon as it&#8217;s available.
