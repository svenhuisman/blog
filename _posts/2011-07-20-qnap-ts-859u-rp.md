**T**his is the fifth post in the [_**SMB/LAB NAS review**_](https://svenhuisman.com/2011/07/smblab-nas-review/). This review compares the following products on features and performance:

**&#8211; [Cisco NSS324](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps10854/index.html)  
** &#8211; **[Iomega IX4-200d](https://iomega-eu-en.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22024)  
** &#8211; **[Netgear ReadyNAS Ultra 6](http://www.netgear.com/home/products/storage/work-and-play/RNDU6000.aspx)  
** &#8211; **[QNAP TS-859U-RP+](http://www.qnap.com/pro_detail_feature.asp?p_id=185)  
** &#8211; **[Synology DS1511+](http://www.synology.com/products/product.php?product_name=DS1511%2B&lang=enu)**

**T**oday I describe my experiences with the the QNAP TS859U-RP+. As I described in the introduction post of this blog series; the models we compare aren’t always really equeal, this proves it. This rack mounted QNAP is one of the most feature rich and business-ready NAS devices we tested, with a dual power supply, dual NIC, MPIO support and 8 bays.

**QNAP TS-859U-RP+ Basics:**  
_\# Disks : 8_  
_\# Hot swappable: Yes_  
_\# CPU : Intel Atom 1,8 Ghz Dual Core_  
_\# RAM : 1 GB DDR2_  
_\# FLASH : 512 MB_  
_\# Protocols : NFS, CIFS, iSCSI, AFB/Bonjour_

**A**s mentioned before, the Cisco and the QNAP devices[<img style="background-image: none; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-top: 0px; margin: 0px 10px; border: 0pt none;" title="image" src="https://svenhuisman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image_thumb3.png" border="0" alt="image" width="244" height="210" align="right" />](https://svenhuisman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/image3.png) are very similar. They use, as far as we can judge, exactly the same hardware and use the same base for the management platform. The biggest advantage of the QNAP TS859U-RP+ is off course the 8 disk bays, which can lead up to 16 TB of storage. Besides that it is the only unit we tested that has 2, replaceable power supply units that are fed by normal 230V power cables (no adapters). The onscreen display is a pro but just like in the Cisco it isn’t very user-friendly so you only want to use this as a last resort!

**F**or the rest, as stated before, it is really packed with loads of features like integrated Amazon S3 support (replicating/backing-up directly and automated to the cloud), a USB print server, AD Support, ISO to share mapping, MySQL server, Download server and a pretty nice feature; Q-package support. Since it is running Linux, there a virtually tons of “apps” you can install on it. You don’t want to go and trick that stuff into your NAS device (which essentially, should just serve files). But QNAP authors and releases certain packages especially (re)build for the QNAP devices. At the moment there are some pretty neat QPKGes available like: OpenLDAP, eyeOS, Twonkymedia 4 server, Joomla, WordPress, SABnzbd+, Asterisk (opensource PBX/VoIP server), XDove (opensource E-mail server) and much more.

**+ Highly redundant**  
**+ Feature packed**

**&#8211;  If I have to name any; price ?**

**STAY TUNED:** Since this isn’t all; after the general reviews we’ll present to you a feature comparison and some performance indicators and of course the general conclusion.
