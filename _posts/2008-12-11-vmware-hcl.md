The Hardware Compatibility Guide from VMware, that PDF-file you have located somewhere between your other important VMwaredocuments but is always outdated so you have to download a new PDF, is now replaced by an online version that is searchable. This online Hardware Compatibility Guide replaces the former Hardware Compatibility Guides for systems, I/O devices, and SAN arrays for ESX 3.0 and greater versions, as well as VMware View Client.

<a title="VMware HCL" href="http://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/search.php" target="_blank">Check it out</a>Â and thanks John Troyer from VMware for the twit!

Unfortunately, this is still a HARDWARE compatibility guide. I would rather see a central compatibility guide for hard- AND software (Guest OS, agents, plugins).
