This white paper is focused on solutions that are anticipated to have an important role in Desktop deployments.

This is a 105 page counting whitepaper about one of the key elements of any Application and Desktop Delivery environment. The UEM Smackdown is an initiative of my employer PQR but mainly <a title="Ruben @ Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/rspruijt" target="_blank">Ruben Spruijt</a> and I am proud I can be a part of it. The last weeks I&#8217;ve spend quite some time on finalizing the work that my coworkers (among who my co-blogger <a href="http://twitter.com/svenh" target="_blank">@Svenh</a>) of PQR had produced over de past few months.

It&#8217;s a must read for anyone interested or working on Application and Desktop Delivery concepts!
