Yesterday I did 2 hands-on lab session at VMworld that were very good and I would suggest to try to get into these labs. When you haven&#8217;t registered there is still a good chance to get in, at least from what I have seen today. There were a lot of people waiting to get in, but I think most of the people that did not register for the lab still could get in.<!--more-->

**LAB 4: VMware vSphere™ 4 &#8211; Performance Optimization & Troubleshooting**

You can expect to use vCenter, esxtop, and vscsiStats to identify and troubleshoot performance issues related to: Improperly configured storage, aggressively over-committed memory, heavy use of SMP virtual machines and other memory, CPU, storage, network, guest OS, and application issues. <a title="Scott Drummonds" href="http://communities.vmware.com/people/drummonds" target="_blank">Scott Drummonds</a> was the presenter of this lab and I must say that he and the other lab-staff members did a real good job. If you can&#8217;t get into this lab, you should really read more about <a title="vscsiStats" href="http://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-10095" target="_blank">vscsiStats</a>.

**LAB 5: VMware vSphere™ 4 &#8211; Security Hardening & Best Practices (vShield Zones)**

In this lab I got the chance to play with the vShield Zones Firewall Virtual Appliance along with the VMware vNetwork Distributed Switch, 802.1Q VLANs, and some of the new role based access controls. It was a good lab to get some hands-on experience with vShield-Zones.
