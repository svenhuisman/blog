Marathon Technologies released <a title="XenApp HA" href="http://www.marathontechnologies.com/offers_blueprint_optimizing_citrix_xenapp_high_availability.html?newsid_press_release=1071" target="_blank">a couple of whitepapers and a blueprint for optimizing Citrix XenApp High Availability</a>. As you know, the technology for HA in Xenserver is actually from Marathon and you can also enable Fault tolerance with Marathon EverRun VM. These documents aren&#8217;t about Xenserver, but &#8220;a _set of planning and implementation tools designed to help companies ensure high availability of applications delivered with Citrix® XenApp™ more efficiently and cost effectively_&#8220;.

The documents are a good read if you want to learn more about XenApp and about how you can protect each component of XenApp.
