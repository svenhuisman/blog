**T**oday I describe my experiences with the <span style="font-weight: normal;">Iomega IX4-200D. It was a pretty wanted device among virtualization fanatics somehow. Iomega, part of the EMC legacy these days, has come up with a couple of different 4-bay NAS devices.</span>

[](https://svenhuisman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/iomega-storcenter-ix4-200d-opened.jpg)One of the strong points of the Iomega is that it dynamically allocates space for iSCSI LUN’s, NFS shares, AFP shares, SMB shares; you don’t have to worry about that at all. Another unique feature is the Bluetooth upload (additional usb Bluetooth dongle needed). It is a bit of an outdated feature when you ask me; every device these days has wifi, but nevertheless a unique feature.<!--more-->

[<img class="alignright" title="Iomega IX4-200d disk swapping" src="https://svenhuisman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/iomega-storcenter-ix4-200d-opened-350x283.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="226" />](https://svenhuisman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/iomega-storcenter-ix4-200d-opened.jpg)Compared to the other devices this is the only one that has no removable drive bays and therefore has no hot-swap functionality.

The device is, feature wise, the least attractive; it has the basic functionality but don’t expect[](https://svenhuisman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Home-Mozilla-Firefox_2011-03-11_22-18-22.png) any other plugins. The interface, I can’t say it otherwise, looks from the stone ages. Even though this device is the one that is on the market the longest I have to say this Iomega; this is not an interface you can offer in 2011, really!

In my eyes a con, but for some maybe a pro; it has an external power adapter (which in my case, made a pretty annoying high squeaking sound).

I really tried to make the part about the Iomega a bit more spicy and interesting but I’m just going to be honest here; this is no exciting device so my inspiration ends here. In my eyes this device definately does not deserve the EMC logo on it![<img class="alignleft" style="border: 0px;" title="Home - Mozilla Firefox_2011-03-11_22-18-22" src="https://svenhuisman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Home-Mozilla-Firefox_2011-03-11_22-18-22_thumb.png" border="0" alt="Home - Mozilla Firefox_2011-03-11_22-18-22" width="220" height="175" align="right" />](https://svenhuisman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Home-Mozilla-Firefox_2011-03-11_22-18-22.png)

**+ Bluetooth support  
** **&#8211; Very outdated interface**  
**&#8211; Limited functionality**  
**&#8211; No hotswapping disks**

**STAY TUNED:** Since this isn’t all; next week after the general reviews we’ll present to you a feature comparison and some performance indicators and of course the general conclusion.
