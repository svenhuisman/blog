My colleague and I are getting ready for VMworld and as you know we will be blogging at this event. To promote our blog, we will be wearing unique VirtualFuture.info polo-shirts. On the back of the shirts, we want to put a funny slogan and maybe you can help us out. Think of a funny slogan that has to do with virtualization and win a VirtualFuture.info polo-shirt! The best 3 slogans will win a shirt and the competition ends August 31 2008 at midnight (CET).

Here are some examples:

&#8220;I blog on virtualfuture.info and all I got was this lousy shirt&#8221;  
&#8220;I got this Hypervishirt from VirtualFuture.info&#8221;  
&#8220;High Available shirt&#8221;
