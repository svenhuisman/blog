**The moment is here, XenDesktop 4 is available!**

Much awaited and true to their promise Citrix has just officially made XenDesktop 4 available for download on the download page of MyCitrix.com : <a href="https://www.citrix.com/English/ss/downloads/results.asp?productID=163057" target="_blank">https://www.citrix.com/English/ss/downloads/results.asp?productID=163057</a> (you need to be registered and login).

<!--more-->So now everybody can go ahead and download the 

<a href="https://www.citrix.com/xendesktop4" target="_blank">Citrix XenDesktop 4</a> Evaluation and try it on their own virtual infrastructure, say XenServer, vSphere, Hyper-V … That’s the power of Citrix XenDesktop: it runs on all these platforms!

For those who might be interested, the Quick PoC Kit is not up-to-date yet with XenDesktop 4, it’s still version 3.1 but I suppose it’ll be updated really soon.

Later this week I’ll dive further into the details of XenDesktop 4 and all of its (unique) features, and because of our Bloggers Battle, I’ll emphasize the pros compared to VMware View 4.

For now: happy downloading !
