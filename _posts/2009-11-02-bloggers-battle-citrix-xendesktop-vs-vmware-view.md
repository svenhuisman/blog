My blogging activities were very low last month (close to none actually) and I apologize for that. It must have been because I spend most of the time crying because my co-blogger Matthijs left the company I work for and he decided to work for the competition. Being competitors at the moment, I thought it was a good idea to do a bloggers-battle on VirtualFuture.info. What does that mean? <!--more-->Well this month, Matthijs and I will each blog about a product and try to convince each other and the readers that &#8220;their&#8221; product is the &#8220;best product&#8221; in it&#8217;s category.

<a title="Xendesktop 4" href="http://www.citrix.com/xd4" target="_blank">Citrix Xendesktop 4</a> was just <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">released</span> announced * a couple of weeks ago and <a title="VMware View 4" href="http://www.vmware.com/products/view/" target="_blank">VMware View 4</a> will be released this month, so these are the products we will blog about this month. Matthijs will defend/present Citrix Xendesktop 4 and I will do the same for VMware View 4. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The blogposts about these products do not always represent our opinion as a consultant</span>. As a consultant, we always choose the product that fits the customer needs.

*I was under the impression that Xendesktop 4 was already released, but the final release of XenDesktop 4 will be generally available on November 16, 2009, just like VMware View 4!

Topics we will discuss this month are:  
&#8211; Why do the vendors think their product is better than their competitor&#8217;s product?  
&#8211; What are the similarities and differences between the two products?  
&#8211; Display protocol differences?  
&#8211; TCO/ROI differences?  
&#8211; Test-results comparison  
&#8211; Managing the virtual desktop infrastructure

We will also use Twitter to promote this bloggers-battle (search for keyword #VFBattle) and all of your input is more then welcome. In fact, if you already have posts about these products, please let us know (<a title="Svenh" href="http://www.twitter.com/svenh" target="_blank">@svenh</a> or @<a title="vf_matt" href="http://www.twitter.com/vf_matt" target="_blank">vf_matt</a>). A battle should have a winner, but how do we decide who wins this blogger-battle? Although we are trying to convince each other, you decide who wins. We are holding a poll to create a baseline of which product the readers prefer based on what they know before the bloggers-battle. At the end of this month, we take another poll and the winner of this bloggers-battle is the one who gains the mosts votes (%).

[poll id=&#8221;2&#8243;] 

I wish Matthijs the best of luck this month and I hope you will all enjoy this battle.
