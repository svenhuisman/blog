Last month the well-known community forum [softgridguru.com](http://www.softgridguru.com/ "Softgridguru") moved to the new <a title="www.appvirtguru.com" href="http://www.appvirtguru.com" target="_blank">Appvirtguru.com</a> site. Here is <a title="appvirtguru.com" href="http://www.softgridguru.com/viewtopic.php?t=3446" target="_blank">the note</a> Ruben Spruijt left behind on [softgridguru.com](http://www.softgridguru.com/ "Softgridguru"):
