VMware released vSphere 4.1 with a couple of new features like &#8220;Memory compression&#8221;, &#8220;Storage I/O Control&#8221; and much more. I&#8217;m not going to repeat all the information, because you can already read it here:

  * <a title="vSphre 4.1" href="http://www.gabesvirtualworld.com/vmware-vsphere-4-1-released-%e2%80%93-what%e2%80%99s-new/" target="_blank">Gabesvirtualworld</a>

  * <a title="vSphere 4.1" href="http://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere/mid-size-and-enterprise-business/features.html" target="_blank">VMware</a>

One thing that I don&#8217;t read is that vMotion is now part of <a title="Features" href="http://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere/mid-size-and-enterprise-business/features.html" target="_blank">vSphere Standard edition</a>. And that&#8217;s a big improvement for a lot of organizations who don&#8217;t need all the features of Advanced or Enterprise (Plus), but do need vMotion for maintenance for example.Â
