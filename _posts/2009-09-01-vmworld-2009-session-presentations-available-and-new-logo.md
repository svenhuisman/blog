I was checking my schedule for VMworld 2009 with the <a title="Schedule builder" href="https://vmworld2009.wingateweb.com/scheduler/catalog/catalog.jsp" target="_blank">online schedule builder</a> and I noticed a pdf-logo in front of some of the sessions. These are the slides of the presentation given during that session. So if you want to know more about a session or if you are not able to get in, you should check the online schedule builder and take a look at the slides.

There are also a couple of <a title="Online only sessions" href="http://www.vmworld.com/community/sessions/2009/" target="_blank">online-only sessions</a> available. These sessions cover topics similar to those from VMworld 2009, but are not actual speaker sessions presented at VMworld in San Francisco.

While I was at [www.vmworld.com](http://www.vmworld.com) I watched <a title="VMware logo" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uFHsZyDesQ" target="_blank">this video</a> where Richard Garsthagen tells about the new VMware logo that was introduced this week. Apparently, the boxes in the logo (representing VM&#8217;s of course) are removed from the logo because VMware is a lot more than that nowadays.
