Sean Clark did a little investigation on licensing a virtual desktop with XP or Vista. It appears you need Vista licensed with software assurance to be able to run a virtualized desktop, even if it is XP you want to deploy in your VDI-environment. This is very interesting and could be a show-stopper for SMB.Â I was not aware of this and perhaps a lot of people aren&#8217;t. So go to Sean&#8217;s blog and <a title="Sean Clark" href="http://seanclark.us/?p=183" target="_blank">read the article</a>.
