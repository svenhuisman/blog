Today VMworld 2009 finally gets started. I will attend 2 interesting hands-on labs and will blog-review them later today. What concerns me however is the number of people waiting in line for sessions already, and the Monday sessions are usually easy to get in to. I can&#8217;t remember seeing this kind of long queues in Las Vegas last year, while there were more people attending VMworld then.Â

I will also release the updated Application virtualization comparison chart today. This time it includes a comparison of launch-time of 5 commonly used applications and the results are very interesting.
