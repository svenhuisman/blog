He plans to post 2 chapters every 2 :weeks and at the end post the books as pdf for free:

_Once we have all free chapters released, we&#8217;ll bundle the whole thing up in one nice PDF package so people can actually travel with all the info they will ever need on VI3._

It&#8217;s really nice that this book will be available for free, but by the time it is, we probably are all into the public release of vSphere 4! ðŸ˜‰
