<img class="alignleft" style="margin: 10px;" title="VMworld Cannes" src="https://www.vmworld.com/images/vmworld_photo_europe2009.jpg" alt="" width="120" height="84" />**J**ust now the <a href="https://www.vmworld.com/community/sessions/europe2009" target="_blank">Break-out sessions from VMworld Europe 2009 in Cannes</a> were made available on-line <a href="https://www.vmworld.com/community/sessions/europe2009" target="_blank">here</a> for those who were there, or at VMworld 2008 @ Las Vegas. Just login with your VMworld account and enjoy. Missed it but are curious to what was presented ? You can <a href="https://www.vmworld.com/community/subscription/" target="_blank">buy yourself a VMworld Subscription</a> for $699,= for one year.

For me personally one of the most interesting sessions was the &#8220;Managing VMware with Powershell&#8221; and that session is filmed completely by Eric Sloof and he posted this on his blog : <https://www.ntpro.nl/blog/archives/990-The-Complete-Managing-VMware-With-PowerShell-Video.html> so that&#8217;s freely available to anyone, nice work Eric !
