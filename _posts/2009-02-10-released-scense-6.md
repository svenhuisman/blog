Today Scense version 6 is released. For those who don&#8217;t know <a href="http://www.scense.nl" target="_blank">Scense</a> yet : it acts in the same area as <a href="http://www.ressoftware.com/" target="_blank">RES</a> PowerFuse: it makes application delivery and desktop management a whole lot easier.

The power of Scense is that they&#8217;re making every process as simple as possible. Scense is already well-known by their Full Session Control. This means that Scense has defined <a href="http://www.scense.nl/Products/Session%20events.aspx" target="_blank">9 moments</a> where you can control your users session, where in a traditional environment you only have 2 : @logon and @logoff.

One of the cool new features is Scense Easy Delivery. Distributing an MSI to a usergroup for example is done as easy as &#8220;Select package&#8221;, &#8220;Select usergroup&#8221;, &#8220;click OK&#8221;. See for yourself here : <a href="http://www.scense.nl/Products/Movies.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.scense.nl/Products/Movies.aspx</a> (first movie).

One of the advantages of Scense is that you configure the application delivery once and you&#8217;ve got it available for the user everywhere (Physical desktop, TS/Citrix-session or in a VDI-session). Some of the most important improvements:

  * Scense Easy Delivery : as mentioned above.
  * Full Microsoft App-V integration : deliver App-V virtualized apps as easy as an MSI package.
  * Global File Type Associations : Centrally manage all filetype associations in every situation.
  * Connectivity : Allows the administrator to analyze the users environment indepth
