After <a href="http://www.vmware.com" target="_blank">VMWare</a>&#8216;s announcements about them raising the prices <a href="http://www.citrix.com" target="_blank">Citrix</a> was to be expected to do the same.

Today I got an e-mail from our Citrix distributor <a href="http://www.cdg.nl" target="_blank">CDG</a> that pricing of the entire Citrix portfolio will go up with 10% starting the 1st of September 2008. This only counts for <!--more-->EMEA, Africa, Asia Pacific and Japan by the way, Americans don&#8217;t need to worry ;).

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>By the way :</strong></span> _Subscription Advantage_ renewal, _reinstatement _and _recovery_, including the _renewals_ for _Appliance_ _maintenace_ and _Hardware_ _Warranty_ pricing will go up with 10% starting the 1st of January 2009.
