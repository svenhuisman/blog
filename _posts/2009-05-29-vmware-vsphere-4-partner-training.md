With your VMware Partner account, login to <a title="VMware Partner Central" href="http://vmwareprod.clickcommerce.com/authenticator/login?returnAddress=http%3A%2F%2Fvmwareprod.clickcommerce.com%3A80%2Findex.jsp" target="_blank">Partner Central</a> and select the  
&#8220;Partner University&#8221; tab for all your vSphere training. 

If you are already VSP and VTSP for VI3, you can simply follow the upgrade path.  
<!--more-->

  
Upgrading from VSP 3 (total 1,5 hours):  
&#8211; Products overview  
&#8211; Solutions overview  
&#8211; VMware pricing & licensing 

Per course you can do the exam with 20 questions each.

Upgrading from VTSP3 (total 4 hours):  
&#8211; Architecture/Upgrade/Migration  
&#8211; Infrastructure Administration  
&#8211; Network  
&#8211; Storage  
&#8211; Inventory management

After this online course, you can do the exam with 40 questions.

New participants must follow the complete course: 4 hours for VSP training and 7 hours for VTSP training.

I found this upgrade very useful in order to understand the basics of selling VMware vSphere 4.

Good luck!
