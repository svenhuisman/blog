Today I had the opportunity to take the VCP 4 beta exam. 270 questions in 4,5 hours.Â  When I was finished I still had more than 1 hour left and I even took a 10 minute break in between. After I finished I decided to review all the questions, trying to remember the question I wasn&#8217;t sure about. Just in case I fail and have to retake the test. ðŸ™‚

What did I do to prepare for this exam? <!--more-->Well, I&#8217;ve been playing with vSphere for a couple of months now, not intensively and just 1 whitebox server. Last month, I attended the What&#8217;s new training. After that, I went on a holiday.Â  When I got back, I hadn&#8217;t received an invitation to the beta exam yet, so I sent VMware an e-mail. I got the invitation 2 days after that, so I registered for the exam. Unfortunately, this week was the final chance to take the beta exam, so with only 2 nights of preparations and a bad sleep last night, I took the exam today. I must say, it was a great opportunity to test my knowledge and too see on which items I need to study more. And now I know.

I still feel there is a chance I still might pass this exam. Like <a title="NTPro.nl" href="http://www.ntpro.nl/blog/archives/1190-Becoming-a-VCP4-will-be-tough.html" target="_blank">Eric Sloof said</a>: only 35% is vSphere related, so the rest is experience and/or similar to the previous version and/or other VMware product related. And if I don&#8217;t pass, I just have to take it again in San Fransisco ðŸ˜‰
