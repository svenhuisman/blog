Today I spoke to someone of <a title="InstallFree Website" href="http://www.installfree.com/" target="_blank">InstallFree</a> (who, in my eyes, use revolutionary application virtualization techniques) about their Bridge and Desktop products.

The release date of their first product, the <a title="InstallFree Bridge Product Info" href="http://www.installfree.com/pageload.aspx?page=products_bridge.html" target="_blank">InstallFree Bridge</a> was the 7th of April this year. More information about the InstallFree Bridge, like DataSheets, WhitePapers and Business Cases can be found <a title="InstallFree Resources" href="http://www.installfree.com/resources.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>.

But today I heared that the release date of their second (full blown) Application Virtualization product, known as the <a title="InstallFree Desktop Product Info" href="http://www.installfree.com/pageload.aspx?page=products_desktop.html" target="_blank">InstallFree Desktop</a>, is set to September this year.
