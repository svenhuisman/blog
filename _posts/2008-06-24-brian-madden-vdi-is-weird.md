Today I visited the <a href="http://www.BrianMadden.com" target="_blank">Brian Madden </a>Event in Enschede (Netherlands). This day was mainly about VDI and the vision Brian has on VDI. It was a great event and hearing Brian speak is always inspiring and makes me think. It was a typical Brian Madden event with quotes like &#8220;_VDI is weird !_&#8221; and &#8220;_If you produce a hammer, everything you see is a nail_&#8220;.

Brian already wrote an article about his vision on VDI: <a href="http://www.brianmadden.com/blog/BrianMadden/Prediction-VDI-will-be-ready-for-wholesale-desktop-replacement-in-2010-Heres-how-well-solve-the-problems-to-get-there" target="_blank">June 2010 VDI will be ready for wholesale desktop replacement</a>. During this day we went a bit further into the VDI story so I&#8217;ll get into that later this week and will also share my opinion about the future of VDI.

Thanks for a great event and for the nice article Brian :)!
