I stumbled up on a nice post from Roland van der Kruk at <a href="https://www.brianmadden.com" target="_blank">BrianMadden&#8217;s site</a> concerning VMware View 3. He wrote a review/introductionÂ that&#8217;s worth reading if you don&#8217;t that much about VMware View 3 yet.<!--more-->

Check out the article here : <https://www.brianmadden.com/blogs/guestbloggers/archive/2009/01/15/an-introduction-to-vmware-view-3-features-and-best-practices-part-1-of-3.aspx>

If you already know VMware View and don&#8217;t think it is interesting you should keep an eye out because in upcoming week he will release part 2 (about Linked Clones) and part 3 (Best Practices). The last one I&#8217;m really looking forward to!
