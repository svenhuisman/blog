I received some information from a company called <a title="www.thirdbrigade.com" href="http://www.thirdbrigade.com" target="_blank">Third Brigade</a> today. The mail was marked as spam, but when I read it, I thought it was quiet interesting (because they offered free software off course).

> _Traditional network security controls and virtual security applications cannot provide sufficient protection for virtualised and cloud computing servers. But Third Brigade VM Protection can._

VM Protection is free enterprise software that quickly establishes a line of defense, for virtual machines, whether deployed in a private or public cloud.

Protects up to 100 VMs with:<!--more-->

  * Firewall
  * Intrusion detection (IDS)
  * Integrity Monitoring
  * Log Inspection
  * Detects suspicious and malicious activity
  * Enforces security policies
  * Ensures compliance with PCI and other regulations
  * Protects Windows and Linux VMs running in any virtualized environment (VMware, Citrix, Microsoft), or a cloud computing environment such as Amazon EC2 or GoGrid.
  * Centralized management
  * Integrates with VMwareÂ® vCenter

When I look at the press release date, it&#8217;s from December 8th. I guess they mailed me because they are present at VMworld Europe 2009 and wanted to draw some extra attention. It worked.

It&#8217;s worth the look at. You can download <a title="VM Protection" href="http://resources.thirdbrigade.com/vmprotection/" target="_blank">VM Protection</a> now.
