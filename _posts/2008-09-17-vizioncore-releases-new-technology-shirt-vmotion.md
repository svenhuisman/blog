Today at VMWorld, Vizioncore demonstrated a brand new technology  called &#8220;shirt-vmotion&#8221;. This technology enables VMware partners to instantly wear a shirt from a Vizioncore sales manager, even when it&#8217;s sweaty and smelly.<!--more-->

Scott Bennett, the regional sales manager of Central Europe from Vizioncore, demonstrated how he took of his shirt, gave it to Johan van Zanten, and instantly put on a Virtualfuture.info shirt himself. It was still a little buggy, because his head was stuck in the shirt, but he promised that this will be fixed very soon.
