Yesterday <a href="https://www.virtual-strategy.com/Features/The-Rumor-Is-True-But-Why-The-Secrecy.html" target="_blank">David Marshall revealed</a> that the rumors that where already spreading around VMworld in Vegas, are true: <a href="https://www.vmware.com" target="_blank">VMware</a> has acquired <a href="https://www.bluelane.com/" target="_blank">Blue Lane Technologies</a>.

Blue Lane might be known by it&#8217;s recently lost Marketing VP <a href="https://gregness.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Greg Ness</a> but especially by the products ServerShield and VirtualShield. One of the reasons VMware adopted Blue Lane, according to David is:

> _That Blue Lane&#8217;s deep understanding of application protocols allows them to focus on network security from the physical datacenter perimeter, which has become increasingly porous, towards the ‘application perimeter&#8217; &#8211; which consists of application-centric security policies based on the logical zoning and partitioning of applications and services rather than machine boundaries._

This might seem like a logical/useful acquisition, but is it? David looks at the matter more closer and raises a couple of very interesting questions. <a href="https://www.virtual-strategy.com/Features/The-Rumor-Is-True-But-Why-The-Secrecy.html" target="_blank">Read the whole story here.</a>
