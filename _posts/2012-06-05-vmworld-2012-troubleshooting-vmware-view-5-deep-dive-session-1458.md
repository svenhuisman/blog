My colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/robbeekmans" target="_blank">Rob Beekmans</a> and I have submitted a session for VMworld this year. The topic we selected was VMware View troubleshooting and we are planning to make this a real deep dive session. The good thing about troubleshooting VMware View is that everything is logged in the View Dashboard, Event database and logfiles. The problem with troubleshooting VMware View is finding the logfile with the right information can be very hard. With this session, we would like you to give a good overview of how VMware View works, what the communication lines are, where to find the logfiles and how to interpret them. Here is a small part of what weâ€™re working on:
