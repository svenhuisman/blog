<a title="Virtualization.info" href="https://virtualization.info" target="_blank">Virtualization.info</a> brings a <a title="Scoop" href="https://www.virtualization.info/2008/06/vmware-to-offer-capacity-planner-for.html" target="_blank">scoop</a> about <a title="VMware's capacity planner" href="https://www.vmware.com/products/capacity_planner/" target="_blank">VMware&#8217;s Capacity planner</a>:

> _**virtualization.info has learned that Capacity Planner will be available free of charge starting on July 1st.**_
> 
> _Partners will not be required to buy any license anymore (even if they will still have to attend a classroom course that doesn&#8217;t come cheap). They will just have to login on the online portal, create a new profile and start monitoring the customer&#8217;s infrastructure._

As I work for a VMware <a title="QNH" href="https://www.qnh.nl" target="_blank">partner</a>, I&#8217;m looking forward to use the Capacity Planner a lot more. ðŸ™‚
