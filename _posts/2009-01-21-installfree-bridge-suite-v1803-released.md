Some big changes are :<!--more-->

&#8211; **_One Sphere_** : You can create application containers, fill them with apps and let them run in/as one sphere. So no you can decide the connectivity setting per application (see screenshot).  
&#8211; **_SELaunch_** : Shell Execute launch provides a basic level of interconnectivity between virtual application and native applications.  
&#8211; **_URL Redirect_** : This enables users to launch a virtual web browser from a native IE.  
&#8211; **_Download Manager_** : improves user experience by sequencing AOD downloads over low bandwidth networks.
