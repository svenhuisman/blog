Today I sat next to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/alanrenouf" target="_blank">Alan Renouf</a> (the British guy ;)) during the &#8220;Managing VMware with Powershell&#8221; session at VMworld Europe 2009 in Cannes and he pointed me to the Quick Reference Guide he released Monday as a great hand-out for beginners as well as experts. I checked it out and it looks really helpfull!

He created the guide with cooperation of C.<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_6" class="blsp-spelling-error">Shanklin</span>, S.Herold, L.<span id="SPELLING_ERROR_7" class="blsp-spelling-error">Dekens</span> and C.Bunch.
