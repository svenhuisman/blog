Today, Sven and I received a nice gift from <a href="https://www.vmware.com" target="_blank">VMware</a>. It&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.theflip.com" target="_blank">Flip Mino</a> for a the official bloggers arranged by Richard Garsthagen, so we can cover VMworld in Cannes in every possible way. We were already prepared with an HD Camcorder but these Flips are handy to carry around at all times. So thanks Richard & VMware !
