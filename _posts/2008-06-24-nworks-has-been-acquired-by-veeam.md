<p class="MsoNormal" style="0cm 0cm 4.5pt;">
  <span>Greg Stephens just dropped me an e-mail:</span>
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="0cm 0cm 4.5pt;">
   <span>Customers have told us that they appreciate the innovation behind our enterprise management systems connectors to VMware.  We&#8217;ve also heard that you sometimes wish we had more developers to devote to continuing enhancement of these products.  With today&#8217;s announcement of <a href="http://www.nworks.com" target="_blank">nworks</a>&#8216; acquisition by <a href="http://www.veeam.com/" target="_blank">Veeam Software</a>, that wish has come true. </span>
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="0cm 0cm 4.5pt;">
  <span>nworks is now part of Veeam Software, an award-winning provider of systems management tools for VMware infrastructures.  Like nworks, Veeam is known for its innovation, but Veeam is a larger organization, with nearly 50 developers focused on VMware.</span>
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="0cm 0cm 4.5pt;">
  <span style="AR-SA;">Veeam is best known for its FastSCP freeware, and the company also offers Veeam Backup, the 2-in-1 backup and replication solution; Veeam Reporter, an automated way to discover and document VMware virtual server environments; Veeam Configurator, a simple way to configure and provision ESX servers;  and Veeam Monitor, for a bird&#8217;s-eye view of key performance metrics across the entire VMware infrastructure.   </span>
</p>

I hope that nworks monitoring will go in a spin off just like FastSCP has been.
