  Yesterday after a 15 hour flight and a lot of waiting in Houston we&#8217;ve arrived at the Las Vegas airport. Got our selves a cab to the MGM grand where all is going down. Registration is very quiet a 6:30 am (off course), got myself the goody bag and casino money coupons and left ðŸ™‚ Oh by the way it was veryÂ thoughfull of Citrix to add an additional cord to the badge whch states your Citrix Status&#8230; This allow me to join the CCIA happy hour which I will attend today.

What is the biggest issue of America? Everything is bigger than anywhere else in the world which means I walk at least 8km a day fromÂ my Hotel room / Casino (MGM Grand)Â to the conference room Â (MGM Grand) and back. At least now I can explain to you why it&#8217;s called MGM **GRAND**.

Read more for a summary of the day.

<!--more-->2 Hours later after loosing all my money sessions were starting, First session we&#8217;ve attended was a commercial session regarding TCO and ROI for Xendesktop (Summit113). I will post a summary of this meeting in a minute. By the way I went here with my colleague Jan de Waal who holds a commercial function within our company, which explains a bit why I&#8217;m not only attending technical sessions.

After this interesting session I went to a technical session regarding Xendesktop 3 architecture and design session (TECH301). This session was unfortunately not a real eye opener. But anyway nice to see.

Next was lunch (everything in US is bigger better strong faster, so no complaints here ðŸ™‚ ) After the lunch I attended the Hands-on-lab (SummitLL706). I usually never attend hands-on-labs, just because they take to much time which will not allow me to attend other interesting sessions. But this year I had to attend a hands-on-lab regarding Workflow studio. I&#8217;ve been struggeling a lot with theÂ just releasedÂ version of Workflow studio as there are so many options.Â Â This tool completes the intended Citrix Delivery Center and it sure does. I will share my findings in another post later on.

Last session we attended was the most interesting (Sorry Sven) &#8220;Citrix Xenserver: Winning competitive server virtualisation deals against VMware&#8221;.Â  Before my head is shot off I would like to remind youÂ thisÂ is a &#8220;sales&#8221; track andÂ it doesn&#8217;t tell usÂ VMware is a lousy product at all ðŸ™‚Â But the title of the track made me curious and didn&#8217;t dissappoint at all. Although many of the comparissionÂ are open doors, it was interesting to see how Citrix intends to position it&#8217;s product in the market.

For today the Summit Â ended yesterday so today we will attendÂ sessions from the Virtualisation Congress, take a walk to the expo hall and iForum sessions. It&#8217;s going to be a busy day and I&#8217;ll try to work with the video flip (Thanks to Sven)Â to make a video with an impression of what I&#8217;ve described earlier.
