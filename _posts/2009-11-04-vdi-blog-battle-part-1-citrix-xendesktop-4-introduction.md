**Okay Sven, the game is on!**

**T**his is my first post in the <a href="https://svenhuisman.com/2009/11/bloggers-battle-citrix-xendesktop-vs-vmware-view/" target="_self">VirtualFuture.Info VDI Blog Battle</a>, to convince Sven, and all you out there, why <a href="https://svenhuisman.com/http:/www.citrix.com/lang/English/lp/lp_1858751.asp" target="_blank">Citrix XenDesktop 4</a> would be the right solution for future desktops. I’ll be talking about Citrix XenDesktop 4 this month and try to point out to you some of the unique features of Citrix XenDesktop 4 and why it would be a better solution then VMware View 4. In this post I won’t go deep into the product, but more into its maker, Citrix, and their vision on VDI.  
**<!--more-->

  
I** would like to start with a little intro about why VDI even exists. I actually hate the VDI-word, I&#8217;d like to say Desktop Virtualization, but since that&#8217;s such a long term, I&#8217;ll use VDI.

**N**ow, we used to do fine without VDI so what’s all the fuzz about, you could say. I personally see Microsoft Terminal Services & Citrix Metaframe / XenApp, wich I’ll be calling TS for now, as the predecessors of VDI. I think VDI was born to overcome the drawbacks that TS had. What were those drawbacks?

&#8211; Shared Windows-environment : interference and limitations  
&#8211; Bad graphical performance (before RDP 6 and HDX support in ICA)  
&#8211; Not all apps were multi-user environment aware or compatible  
&#8211; Poor peripheral support, USB devices etc.  
&#8211; Only for on-line use, not off-line

_VDI is about to solve all these problems_… some say.

**I** disagree. Some say VMware is pushing VDI so hard because they won the server virtualization market and just thought; “_hey what’s next_?”. There might be something into that but we do have to remember that they have a big share in spreading the VDI-concept as we know it now. But I do think it&#8217;s true that because they have no other desktop presentation platform they have to push VDI as being the (only) way to go for your desktops. For Citrix that’s different: for them it’s just another way of getting the app to the user, and that’s a game they know!

**S**o this where I see the power of Citrix. Citrix knows the end-user. Citrix knows its way around desktops, profiles, applications; the complete package. Citrix has shown this for years and I believe Citrix still shows this with their <a href="http://www.citrix.com/English/ps2/products/product.asp?contentID=683711" target="_blank">Citrix Delivery Center concept</a>.

**So I&#8217;d like to end with this. Citrix does not sell VDI as a holy grail; Citrix sells it as an add-on, with the means to use it where it makes sense. And that’s the way to treat VDI in my opinion, and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;d choose Citrix: their vision on Desktop Virtualization is the right one !**
