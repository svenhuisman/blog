<a title="Run-virtual.com" href="http://www.run-virtual.com" target="_blank">Richard Garsthagen</a>, the organizer of VMworld Europe, has given a preview on <a title="VMworld.com" href="http://www.vmworld.com/blogs/vmworldeurope2009/2009/02/15/vmworld-preview-1-more-week-to-go" target="_blank">www.vmworld.com</a> of the biggest virtualization in Europe:

> _It will be a challenge to pick what sessions you want to go see as there will be around 140 sessions and 13 labs to choice from. A good start might be \*+“DC14 &#8211; Overview of 2009 VMware datacenter products”+\* and **“DC07 &#8211; Tech Preview: vCenter Server”**.  
> We have reserved the Thursday afternoon for all the top scored sessions from  
> the previous 2 ½ days to give you a second chance to go see them, in case you  
> missed them._
> 
> _The hands-on labs this year will also have many new interesting topics. You will be able to get your hands-on the upcoming Cisco Nexus 1000v (LAB12), explore the next generation of datacenter software (LAB01) and have a first look at a VMsafe application from Altor Networks in the form of a virtual firewall (LAB13). All the labs will be self-paced and a large crew of VMware Lab Staff will be there to help you to guide yourself through these labs. As they are self-paced, you can come to the hands-on labs any time you like and spend as much or little  
> time you have. If there is no available terminal for you, we can even allow a certain amount of ‘bring-your-own-machine’ to create even more capacity and in case you have a funky keyboard like the Belgiums do, you can work with what you are used to._

Matthijs and I will be doing live (video-)blogging at VMworld Europe this year, so expect lots of content on VirtualFuture.info!
