Last week Citrix announced Dazzle on Synergy. Unfortunately I haven&#8217;t been able to post about this matter in Vegas due to technical issues. Anyhow Dazzle will take application delivery to the next stage. Earlier last week Mark Templeton showed a slide with the four phases for data center improvement and defined their delivery center being with products available now moving to phase 3 automation. Dazzle will take the data center further into phase 3.

<!--more-->Citrix Dazzle takes  big step to a Self Service center. Citrix Dazzle is a front end box that can be compared with Itunes. It stores all user specific info, data and applications. It allows users to add applications from a the IT approved list, this will start an automated process which delivers the application to th user after approval. Together with workflow studio and labmanager it will take the data center from flexible (what will impove more with XenServer 5.5) to Automation. This means costs will decreasing and the user will get

Cool feature is that Dazzle is webbased. Most users this time know their way around on a website, which will improve the user experience. In my opinion the most coolest part I&#8217;ve seen is the &#8220;Starmenu&#8221;. This is an application menu based on the title scene of starwars very cool. And next to the website there will be start menu integration as well. This makes it a complete package and will be a nice expansion of XenApp and XenDesktop. It&#8217;s announced to be released the second half of this year&#8230;

I can&#8217;t wait to get it up and running.
