VMware is organizing a nine-part <a href="https://communities.vmware.com/community/vmtn/desktop/view/bootcamp" target="_blank">VMware View Bootcamp</a>: every day a new video is published for you to view. At the end of this bootcamp, you will have a good understanding of the VMware View solution, how to roll it out and how to optimize View in your environment. A free e-book of all the presentations is included in this bootcamp series.

> “We will lock the discussions for the video each night and move on to the next video.we will show you how to get started and successfully roll out and deploy your virtual desktops and applications. We will have sessions covering everything from storage and networking best practices to PCoIP tuning and optimizing your base image. We will also touch on VMware&#8217;s new security server for PCoIP and how you can take advantage of powershell to write your own scripts for View.”
