vExpert is the buzz word in the blogging-scene at the moment. EverybodyÂ is (quietly/modestly) hyping themselves to get nominated as possible VMware vExpert. But I was following John Troyer on Twitter and while talking to Sven he said :

> _&#8220;vExpert nomination is also application form. Don&#8217;t make others do the work for you, lazy bum! Nominate yourself. You know better than others what you&#8217;ve been up to.&#8221;_

So everybody who think he&#8217;s been active enough in the VMware community by helping customers implement VMware, spread the word about VMware, helped users in the VMware communities with their problems: sign yourself up!
