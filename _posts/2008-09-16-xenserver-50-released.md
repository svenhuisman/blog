Citrix has released the new edition of XENServer. This version mainly focusses on High Availabilty and takes this to a new level! As told before in earlier posts Citrix has partnered up with Marathon and created a super High Available infrastructure. This infrastructure is able to create a XenApp environment that is so high available that when a physical server which hosts a virtual XenApp server dies, another server takes over the virtual machine without users losing sessions and even worse their work. There&#8217;s a very cool [interview](http://www.xenserver5.com/whatsnew.php) with the &#8220;Hypervisor Guru&#8221; Simon Crosby on the citrix website in which he explains the new features and high availabilty options.

With the realease of the XENServer 5.0 a new version of XENCenter is released aswell. In the first version of XENcenter a lot of small issues made the management a lot more complicated than for example in Virtual Center. With the new release of XENcenter a big step forward is made. Later on this month I&#8217;ll publish a review of XENCenter 5.0 on this Blog.
