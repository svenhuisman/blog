This is the last post of our SMB NAS review and comparison.

In the previous period we reviewed these units:

**&#8211; [Cisco NSS324](https://svenhuisman.com/2011/07/cisco-nss324/)  
** &#8211; **[Iomega IX4-200d](https://svenhuisman.com/2011/07/iomega-ix4-200d/)  
** &#8211; **[Netgear ReadyNAS Ultra 6](https://svenhuisman.com/2011/07/netgear-readynas-ultra-6/)  
** &#8211; **[QNAP TS-859U-RP+](https://svenhuisman.com/2011/07/qnap-ts-859u-rp/)  
** &#8211; **[Synology DS1511+](https://svenhuisman.com/2011/07/synology-ds1511-nas-review/)**

The goal was to get to know the units; their pro&#8217;s and con&#8217;s. If possible even some performance figures.  
But the focus was: features and that we compared, extensively. The results are not easy to provide in this post and to keep it readable we produced a PDF-file that compares al the units in a very detailed manner.

You can download that review by clicking [here](https://svenhuisman.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/VirtualFuture.Info%20-%20NAS%20Comparison%202011%20-%20Feature%20Overview%201.0.pdf "NAS Feature Comparison").

And then about performance; we tested all units with the same disks, except for the IOmega; since that unit comes with it&#8217;s own disks that cannot be replaced.  
At this moment we don&#8217;t have the performance-test results ready yet but because feature-info get&#8217;s outdated fast we wanted to get the feature-comparison out now.

We will get back later with performance info.

A small peek into the (virtual)future: the absolute winner was (not really suprising) the QNAP TS859 with throughput speeds that stopped at 110 MB/s because of the 1GB network limit in our lab, Synology following closely. The unit that ended in the bottom of the list was the Iomega struggling to get a 40 MB/s performance, and not a steady one either&#8230;
