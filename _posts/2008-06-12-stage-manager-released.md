  Stage Manager, Lab Manager, Lifecycle Manager, Site Recovery Manager. Confused? I am.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  Yesterday <a title="VMware.com" href="http://www.vmware.com" target="_blank">VMWare</a> released their product Stage Manager. I decided to do some investigation and end my confusion. A quick scan of the release notes did not solve the puzzle. Therefore I decided to dig deeper and consulted my good friend <a title="Google" href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a> to help out.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  The summary of my investigating is:
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  <strong><a title="Labmanager" href="http://www.vmware.com/products/labmanager/" target="_blank">Lab Manager</a></strong> is product primarily for use in large test environment where the test users can share resources like DNS Server, AD Servers, Exchange servers etc. This will mainly be used in large companies with a software development department.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  <strong><a title="Stage Manager" href="http://www.vmware.com/products/sm/overview.html" target="_blank">Stage Manager</a></strong> is focused on administrating the creation of applications in a <strong>production</strong> environment where the different phases in the development of applications can be recorded by using snapshots.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  <strong><a title="Lifecycle manager" href="http://www.vmware.com/products/lcm/" target="_blank">Lifecycle Manager</a></strong> is a tool to ease the administration and management of a virtual infrastructure. This is done by automating<span> </span>the creation, managment<span> </span>and eventually deleting of virtual machines when they are ultimately at the end of life.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  <strong><a title="Site recovery manager" href="http://www.vmware.com/products/srm/" target="_blank">Site Recovery Manager</a></strong> is a disaster recovery solution that can be managedÂ with the VMware virtual infrastructure and the replication possibilities of the SAN-vendors.
