**M**y first reaction was a pretty big laughter when I read <a href="https://www.virtualization.info/2009/03/sap-to-virtualize-500-servers-with.html" target="_blank">the article that stated that SAP is going to use XenServer to virtualize about 500 servers</a>. The laughter is, as Alessandro states, because of the fact that during Paul Maritz&#8217; keynote at VMworld Europe 2009 in Cannes 2 weeks ago, SAP got over 30 minutes of (my valuable !!!) time for a (pretty boring) presentation about what amazing stuff they were doing with VMware.

**B**ut after a couple of seconds I thought : wow&#8230; SAP is one of the first big companies that I&#8217;ve heard of (please correct me if I&#8217;m wrong) that&#8217;s actaully doing this; using multiple hypervisors next to eachother. And honestly who can blame them? I think that in a couple of years we&#8217;ll all be doing the same. I see the management tooling-market growing faster then ever and that&#8217;s because more and more people/companies are aware of the fact that the hypervisor itself is becoming commodity and it&#8217;s all down to using the right tools to manage it.

**A**s my co-blogger <a href="https://svenhuisman.com/2009/03/xenserver-50-enterprise-ready/" target="_blank">Wouter Heije already stated today : Citrix XenServer 5 seems to be enterprise ready</a>. And there are more and more indications (like the <a href="https://virtualizationreview.com/features/article.aspx?editorialsid=2641" target="_blank">Hypervisor Lab Experiment</a> by <a href="https://www.virtualizationreview.com" target="_blank">VirtualizationReview.com</a> that show that Citrix XenServer outperforms ESX when it comes down to heavy utilized vm&#8217;s) that show that VMware is loosing ground when it comes down to the hypervisor itself.

**T**ools like <a href="https://www.vworkspace.com/" target="_blank">Quest vWorkspace</a> (which amazed me at their booth in Cannes) that can manage your entire virtual desktop infrastructure (Terminal Services, VMware View, Citrix XenDesktop, Blade PC&#8217;s and so on) from within one interface look like the way to go.

**Conclusion:  
I** don&#8217;t think that SAP is making a weird move, I think they might be ahead of their time; I think that what SAP is doing is what we will all be doing in the near future. I&#8217;m not saying that this is the way to go now because I&#8217;ve seen little management tooling at the moment that can really manage every hypervisor to the max, but I think we&#8217;ll get there, maybe even sooner than you might think!
