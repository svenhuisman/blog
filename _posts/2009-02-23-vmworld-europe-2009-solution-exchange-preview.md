This afternoon we were given the opportunity to see the solution exchange at VMworld Europe 2009, which will open tomorrow. The opportunity was given by a person who would like toÂ remain anonymous. It did cost us a VirtualFuture.info shirt, but it was worth it, especially the CA-booth, check the video!
