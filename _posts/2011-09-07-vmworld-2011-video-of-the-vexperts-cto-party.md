I was one of the lucky vExperts who was invited for a VMware CTO party at VMworld. I must admit, this was the best “party” of VMworld this year. Not just because of the great food, nice cocktails and super location, but because of all the people that were there. I had a lot of interesting conversations with vExperts, VMware engineers, architects and product managers of topics I was interested in: End User Computing. My compliments go to one man especially: John Troyer. He did a great job connecting people with each other, as he knows which persons shared the same interest.

Anyway, here is a video I shot at the CTO party.
