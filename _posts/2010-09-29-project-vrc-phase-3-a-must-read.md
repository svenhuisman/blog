Finally we&#8217;ve completed phase 3 of <a title="VRC" href="http://www.virtualrealitycheck.net/" target="_blank">Project VRC</a>. For the past months we&#8217;ve worked very hard and performed a lot of tests to compare VDI workloads and the results are very interesting, to say the least. If you&#8217;re interested in VDI, Windows 7 (on vSphere) and IOPS you really should read this whitepaper!

This whitepaper is focused on VDI; Windows XP and Windows 7 are extensively compared running on vSphere. For example; the I/O behavior of Windows XP and Windows 7 is investigated in detail. By evaluating the different phases of a desktop workload, completely new insights and best practices are given.

It&#8217;s great to see what kind of impact tweaking Windows and vSphere has on IOPS and number of users you can get on a VDI-host (which will lower the cost per desktop).
