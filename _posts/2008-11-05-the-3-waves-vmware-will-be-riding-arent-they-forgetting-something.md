**I stumbled** on <a href="http://techstrategypartners.wordpress.com/2008/10/19/is-vmwares-hyper-growth-phase-over-2/" target="_blank">a nice post on TechStrategyPartners</a> from George Gilbert and Juergen Urbanski. It gives a clear view on which areas <a href="http://www.vmware.com" target="_blank">VMware</a> will be putting their money on and why. It&#8217;s a pretty large piece of reading material and I had a couple of &#8220;duh&#8221; moments but the core of what they&#8217;re telling comes down to this:

We&#8217;ve all seen the light concerning server consolidation, it&#8217;s (becoming) commodity. So what, at this moment, are the areas where the money is ? According to the authors (VMware stakeholders), VMware has defined 3 waves they are setting out to ride the next period :<!--more-->

**_1. Business Continuity : High Availability & Disaster Recovery_**

**_2. Datacenter Automation : Virtual Datacenter OS_**

**_3. Desktop Virtualization : VDI_**

I think VMware has addressed exactly those points where companies momentarily are feeling the pain. With all the stuff they&#8217;ve presented at VMworld in Vegas they showed that they are really creating and maturing the technologies needed for those 3 waves.

**But** I do have to say that I&#8217;m missing the Application Virtualization part in their setting. They have bought Thinstall (ThinApp) so they appear to compete in that area to but it&#8217;s a bit quiet in that space lately when you ask me.

And that while I, as a consultant, see more and more companies looking at migrating their desktop platform (to physical or virtual machines) and looking for a way to prevent the application hell by using an Application Virtualization solution like <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/thinapp/" target="_blank">ThinApp</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/systemcenter/appv/default.mspx" target="_blank">App-V</a> or <a href="http://www.installfree.com" target="_blank">InstallFree</a>. And I think that that&#8217;s the most logical step for companies to make now : virtualize your apps. As soon as you&#8217;ve done that you are way more flexible with your complete desktop infrastructure.

So while I completely understand and agree on the 3 waves VMware has defined, I do wonder if they are not underestimating the market for application virtualization, especially since it&#8217;s, in my opinion, one of the first steps towards a more flexible infrastructure.
