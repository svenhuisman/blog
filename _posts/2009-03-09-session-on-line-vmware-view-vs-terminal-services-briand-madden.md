**I**&#8216;m personally still anxiously waiting for the VMworld Europe 2009 sessions to come on-line,  since it was said they would be released at the end of the first week of March &#8230;

But to give you a sneak preview (even for those who won&#8217;t have access to the official sessions when they get on-line) ; I found <a href="http://blip.tv/file/1852104" target="_blank">Brian Maddens session on blip-tv.com</a> concerning his comparison between VMwware View and Terminal Services and I wanted to share it with you. Check it out below.<!--more-->

Update : This session has just been officially released on vmworld.com so if you have access (Subscription, VMworld 2008 visitor or VMworld Europe 2009 visitor) you can check the session here : <http://www.vmworld.com/docs/DOC-2777>
