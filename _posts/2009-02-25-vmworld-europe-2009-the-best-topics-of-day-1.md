**[](https://svenhuisman.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/alan.jpg)O**ff-course today VirtualFuture attended Day 1 of VMworld Europe 2009 @ Cannes and we decided to share with you our moments:

**Worst and best magic trick of the day** 



You&#8217;re witnessing the Veeam Magician in action here. A bit unfair we&#8217;re showing a trick gone wrong because the past couple of days he&#8217;s entertaining us with amazing tricks !

**Booth babe of the day**

**Blogger of the day  
** Paul Shannon of <http://www.vm-aware.com> : man, does this guy blog or what : 8 articles on Day 1 and all of them tell something interesting, great work Paul ! 

**Funniest Frenchman of the day  
** [<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-913" title="alan" src="https://svenhuisman.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/alan.jpg" alt="" width="141" height="78" />](https://svenhuisman.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/alan.jpg)Mr. Alan Renouf from <a href="http://teckinfo.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Virtu-Al</a> is probably very proud to be crowned Funiest Frenchman. Off-course this is a title that can&#8217;t be won easily but he earned this by actively confusing everybody by giving them stickers or even t-shirts which state : &#8220;@alanrenouf is english&#8221;.

**Hands-on lab of the day  
** The Cisco Nexus 1000V lab, <a href="https://svenhuisman.com/2009/02/vmworld-europe-2009-cisco-nexus-1000v-hands-on-lab/" target="_blank">click here for details</a>.

**Party of the day  
** It was hard to get in, but we were glad we made it: VMware Benelux party. 

**Goodie of the day  
** Not actually a goodie, but I &#8220;won&#8221; a copy of the book from Steve Beaver by <a href="http://www.tripwire.com" target="_blank">TripWire</a>, nice !
