Veeam, known of their freeware FastSCP program to copy files to ESX servers, has released the third version of their Veeam Reporter Enterprise.

This is part of the mail I received from Veeam:

The beta is over &#8230; the first reporting solution specifically designed for documentation and change management in large VMware Infrastructure 3 environments is now generally available.

<!--more-->

   Features include:

  * Unattended data collection & ad hoc reporting
  * Change management support
  * Help for &#8220;VM sprawl&#8221;
  * Client/server architecture with SQL Server backend 
  * And more <a href="https://https://veeam.com/vmware-esx-reporting_enterprise.html" target="_blank">here</a>

As I read over these features and I think of the new features I heard from VMware and their new to be version of the Datacentre OS it will get rough on Veeam. But for all the current VI3 implementations it will be a great add-on.
