<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1317" title="Microsoft App-V" src="https://svenhuisman.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/appv-logo.png" alt="Microsoft App-V" width="141" height="117" />**M**icrosoft announced the immediate availability of the <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/InvitationUse.aspx?ProgramID=3601&InvitationID=AV46-X6WJ-4DKR&SiteID=285" target="_blank">App-V 4.6 beta from Microsoft Connect</a>.

One of the major improvements is that the sequencer now packages native 64-bit applications, and with this they seem to be the first in the market ! Off course this is a beta and the question is whether Microsoft will really be the first to release an RTM product that packages 64-bit apps.

Another big change <!--more--> is that this version of App-V supports X64 platforms (like Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2 etc.) as well as the X86 platform.
