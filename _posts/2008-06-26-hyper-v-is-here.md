I don&#8217;t think that Hyper-V is the best product on the market to provide a full blown virtualization infrastructure but hey; it&#8217;s a Microsoft products so we all know that a load of organizations will adopt it anyways. So I&#8217;ll install it this weekend, just because I need to know it, not because I want to ;).
