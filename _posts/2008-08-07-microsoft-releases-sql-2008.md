OK, I must admit it has nothing to do with virtualization as such, but we all use a kind of database to store our configs and reporting data. In that light it&#8217;s important to know that Microsoft has released another one of their flagships namely SQL 2008. I must emphasize that little of the products we use are yet supported with this version but that will not take long so we soon will see that support. So it&#8217;s better to be prepared.
