As we suspected Citrix officially released the first official version of the Iphone XenApp receiver on Synergy. A lot of demo-ing is done here at Citrix Synergy. I have to admit I downloaded an earlier release and tested a lot with this version. The new version is more stable, is able to make use of the new HDX technology for better multimedia performance, and most of all once installed is easy to configure and use.

A bunch of links regarding the Citrix receiver for Iphone are these:

I hope everyone is as enthusiastic as I am about this receiver because it makes my life a lot easier.
