Roland van der Kruk at <a title="Brian Madden" href="https://www.brianmadden.com" target="_blank">BrianMadden&#8217;s site</a> posted part 2 of his trilogy concerning VMware View 3. In this part Roland discusses Linked Clones, a.k.a. View Composer. <!--more-->

Roland explains what View Composer is, how it works and what the advantages are. He also explains what recompose, refresh and rebalance exactly does.
