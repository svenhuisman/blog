I received an e-mail from George Kostiuk, President and CEO from emBoot stating the his company has been aquired by Double Take. <a href="http://www.emboot.com" target="_blank">emBoot</a> is a company has some very interesting products like netBoot/i en Winboot/i which we will discuss in a later stadium. But Double Take is partner of VMware so there&#8217;s the link with Virtualization.
