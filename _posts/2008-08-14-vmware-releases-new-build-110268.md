VMWare has released a new build of their flagship products ESX3.5Update2 (build #110268) and ESX3i 3.5Update2 (build #110271), due to the problems mentioned earlier on this blog. VMWare kept their promise to fix the problems with the expiration bug very quick. The updated binaries can be downloaded <a href="http://www.vmware.com/download/vi/" target="_blank">here</a>.
