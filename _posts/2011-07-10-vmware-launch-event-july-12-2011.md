VMware CEO Paul Maritz and CTO Steve Herrod will be presenting on the next generation of cloud infrastructure. Join this online event and experience how the virtualization journey is helping transform IT and ushering in the era of Cloud Computing. The event is called: &#8220;Raising the Bar, Part V&#8221; and vSphere 5 will probably be a big part of this event. I wonder if there is anything else going to be announced&#8230;

The program for the online event looks very promising with three tracks of deep dive breakout sessions!
