Mike Laverick just posted the new 2.0 beta of the well know UDA (Ultimate Deployment Appliance). For those who don&#8217;t know this appliance yet it&#8217;s an appliance with a web-based interface that you can use to deploy your different operating systems to hosts. This can very well be used to deploy VMware ESX.

The new 2.0 beta is interesting because there should be some ESX/vSphere 4.0 support in there. I haven&#8217;t had the time to test it yet but sounds likeÂ great work Mike!
