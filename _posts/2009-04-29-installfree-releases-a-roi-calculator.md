InstallFree released a <a title="ROI-calculator" href="http://www.installfree.com/resources/roi-calculator/" target="_blank">ROI-calculator</a> which allows you to calculate the current costs and possible savings of an organization when using InstallFree to virtualize the applications:

> _InstallFree provides application virtualization software that is used by enterprises to lower the cost and complexity of delivering and managing applications. This approach utilizes the existing infrastructure in an Enterprise, while showing dramatic results in reducing the overall cost of application management._
> 
> _InstallFree has created the &#8220;InstallFree Return on Investment (ROI) Calculator&#8221; to help Enterprises understand their own current costs and measure the immediate savings an InstallFree implementation has on the organization._

I don&#8217;t know how real these numbers are, but I do believe that application virtualization solutions like InstallFree lowers the operational costs of managing applications in an organization.
