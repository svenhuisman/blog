VMware is organizing an <a title="VMware online Virtualization Forum" href="https://event.on24.com/eventRegistration/EventLobbyServlet?target=registration.jsp&eventid=160343&sessionid=1&key=227FB7C9518EC471D80250577AAA0728&sourcepage=register&src=undefined&ossrc=undefined" target="_blank">online virtualization event</a> on November 10th and 11th:

_VMware virtual events are highly interactive events conducted online using only a web browser. They include all of the areas that you may find at a physical event, including an exhibit hall, auditorium, resource center and networking lounge._

This event should especially be interesting for the ones wanting to know more about VMware View 4. There are a couple of sessions on the <a title="Agenda" href="http://info.vmware.com/content/VirtualizationForum_OnlineForum" target="_blank">agenda</a> regarding the upcoming version of VMware View. This is also the reason why I&#8217;m going to attend this event, because if I want to win the <a title="Bloggers-Battle" href="https://svenhuisman.com/2009/11/bloggers-battle-citrix-xendesktop-vs-vmware-view/" target="_blank">bloggers-battle</a>, I definitely need to get more information from VMware about VMware View 4. Until now, there isn&#8217;t that much official information available.
