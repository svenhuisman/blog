There is a nice simulation of VMware vSphere FT available on the net I want to share with you. During the simulation you have the possability to enable FT logging, enable FT for a VM and simulate a faillure of the primary VM which is running FT.

You can access the Flash simulator here:

It&#8217;s a short simulation of how FT works in the real world without installing multiple VMware vSphere hosts and VM&#8217;s. The simulator allows you to activate FT and shows the benefit of this technology.
