<a title="virtualization.info" href="http://virtualization.info" target="_blank">Virtualization.info</a> comes with the news that as of next week, <a title="ESXi for free" href="http://www.virtualization.info/2008/07/vmware-to-release-esx-3i-for-free-next.html" target="_blank">VMware ESXi will be available for free</a>.

> _During the Q2 2008 earnings call the company announced that before the end of July it will release the Update 2 for VMware Infrastructure 3.5 and that will give away the lightweight edition of the product, ESX 3i, for free._

It was already expected and sort of announcedÂ that ESXi would soon be available for free, but I expected it to be announced at VMworld 2008. This is going to give a great boost to <a title="VMware.com" href="http://www.vmware.com" target="_blank">VMware</a> in the SMB market.

I&#8217;m wondering if this affects the pricing of VI 3.5 standard and enterprise, as these products also contains the basic hypervisor&#8230;
