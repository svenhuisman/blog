Yesterday VMWare announched that founder and CEO of VMWare Diane Greene is replaced immediately by ex-Microsoft executive Paul Maritz. It needs to be said that Paul Maritz, wasn&#8217;t working at Microsoft for over 8 years, but nevertheless it&#8217;s an interesting move.

For those who keep close track on VMWare&#8217;s public activities and announcements it&#8217;s known that the CEO of EMC and the CEO of VMWare had some differences in opinion [_understatement_].

The direct effect at this point is <!--more-->that VMWare stocks dropped almost 30%!

Brian Ducharme and David Marshall had an interesting discussion about this subject available in podcast format. You can find it here:
