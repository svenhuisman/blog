On various blogs people are speculating about the release of the Citrix XenApp plugin for the Iphone on the Citrix Synergy Event. I cannot wait till the plugin is available. Funny part is, seems like the development work has been done already and it&#8217;s just waiting for the release, some blogs&nbsp;sugest the plugin&nbsp;has already been sent to the Itunes store. A demo of the <a class="" title="XenApp Plugin" href="https://www.iphoneclub.nl/23365/nieuwe-apps-coolgorilla-phrasebooks-typeit4me-xenapp/" target="_blank">Xenapp Plugin</a>&nbsp;can be viewed since MACworld 2009.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll keep you posted during the Synergy event.
