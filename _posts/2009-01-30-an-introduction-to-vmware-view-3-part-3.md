As I mentioned part 1 and 2, I wanted to be complete and post a reference to part 3 as well:

Roland van der Kruk at <a title="part 3" href="http://www.brianmadden.com/blogs/guestbloggers/archive/2009/01/26/an-introduction-to-vmware-view-3-part-3-of-3-special-considerations-and-best-practices.aspx" target="_blank">BrianMadden&#8217;s site</a> posted part 3 of his trilogy concerning VMware View 3. In this part Roland has some concerns about display protocol and remote secure access. 

I enjoyed reading the 3 VMware View articles of Roland. As a matter of fact, I started a VMware View pilot myself and I can relate to both positive and negative findings of Roland. I will write some blogposts of my own findings in the upcoming weeks.
