This weekend I&#8217;ve made my reservation for <a title="VMworld 2008" href="http://www.vmworld.com/conferences/2008/" target="_blank">VMworld 2008 in Las Vegas</a>. I&#8217;m attending this conference together with a colleague, Johan van Zanten. We are planning to keep track of the sessions we visit and blog about it on virtualfuture.info. So please come back to this site if you want to know what happens in Vegas (from 15-18 september that is)&#8230;
