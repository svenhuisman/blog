<span class="contentpagetitle"><a href="https://www.channelinsider.com/c/a/Solution-Builder/VARs-Choose-VMware-for-Server-Virtualization" target="_blank">The Channel Insider</a> has a nice article with several VARs in the US and their opinion on which side to choose, <a title="VMware" href="https://www.vmware.com" target="_blank">VMware</a>, <a title="Citrix" href="https://www.citrix.com" target="_blank">Citrix</a>, <a title="Microsoft" href="https://www.microsoft.com" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> or even <a title="Virtual Iron" href="https://www.virtualiron.com/" target="_blank">Virtual Iron</a>. It seems that VMware is still the organization to beat but Citix and Microsoft are both strong competitors with a very long breath.</span>
