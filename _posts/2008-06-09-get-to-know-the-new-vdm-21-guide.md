<span style="EN-US;">Doug Brown, known for the </span><span style="minor-latin;"><a href="https://www.dabcc.com/miab/" target="_blank"><span style="EN-US;">Methodology in a Box</span></a></span> <span style="minor-latin;">(a 900+ page guide for installing and deploying a successful Citrix environment), has written a new white paper this time on how to get you up and running with VDM, as quick as possible, even if you have never used VDM before. It is downloadable </span><span style="minor-latin;"><a href="https://www.vmware.com/resources/techresources/1058" target="_blank"><span style="EN-US;">here</span></a></span><span style="minor-latin;">. </span>

<p style="14.25pt;">
  <em><span style="minor-latin;"> I&#8217;ve actually been evaluating and testing VMware&#8217;s VDM 2.x solutions since the early beta&#8217;s were available. I must admit, I very much liked what I saw in the early beta releases.  I feel the beauty of VDM is that it is easy it is to deploy, administer, and use. That being said, while I was evaluating VDM, I thought it might be fun to document how to install, configure, and use it.  You know, I wanted to document the exact steps I used to install my VDM 2.1 lab environment. I wanted to create a <strong><span>VDM in a Box</span></strong>! </span></em><em></em>

  <span style="EN-US;">In other words go and try it yourself.</span>
