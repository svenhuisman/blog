VirtualFuture is sneaking around the <a href="https://www.vmworld.com" target="_blank">VMworld</a> complex in Cannes and somehow we ended up in the Hands-on lab area and off-course we&#8217;d like to give you guy&#8217;s a heads-up (including a flip-video):

It was still quit messy but I talked to someone from VMware and he said that everything was pretty much under control and that nightly hours were not expected.

So we&#8217;re looking forward to the various labs the upcoming days!
