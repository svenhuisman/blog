First we&#8217;d like to thank everyone for <a title="Competition" href="https://svenhuisman.com/2008/08/win-a-virtualfutureinfo-polo-shirt/" target="_blank">submitting their entry</a>. It was hard to select the best 3, because they were all good.  
Here are the winning slogans:

Real Men use Real Hypervisors (Rob Mokkink)  
You Never Forget your first P2V (Tim)  
Be Wiser, use a Hypervisor (Scott Lowe)

The winners will be informed shortly.

For everyone else who would like to get a virtualfuture.info shirt, just ask us at VMworld 2008 or the &#8220;<a title="VMworld in vogelvlucht" href="https://svenhuisman.com/2008/08/kom-naar-vmworld-2008-in-vogelvlucht/" target="_self">VMworld 2008 in vogelvlucht</a>&#8221; event. We probably will be bringing some extra shirts to those events.
