Yesterday VMware released the so called OSPs. OSP stands for Operating system Specific Package and is a packaging and distribution mechanism for VMware Tools. It delivers the packages in a native format for that OS/distribution (e.g. DEB, RPM etc.).

I consider myself lucky to work with Windows VM&#8217;s only at the moment, where VM Tools distribution is easy as hell, but for those who have Linux VM&#8217;s this might make things easier :).

These packages only work for ESX 3.5 U2 and U3. You can find more info here : <a title="OPS" href="http://www.vmware.com/download/packages.html" target="_blank">http://www.vmware.com/download/packages.html</a>
