At <a title="Tech-ed 2008" href="http://www.microsoft.com/events/teched2008/itpro/default.mspx" target="_blank">Microsoft Tech-Ed 2008</a> a <a title="new training and certification" href="http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/Features/2008/jun08/06-10mscert.mspx" target="_blank">new training and certification program</a> was announced. It looks like Microsoft is taking this virtualization-thing seriously ;-).

> _A prime example of a cutting-edge technology with tremendous potential to cut costs and increase efficiency is virtualization._

Microsoft Learning has created a series of training and <a title="MCTS" href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcts/default.mspx" target="_blank">Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist</a> (MCTS) certification programs that focus on <a title="Hyper-V" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2008/en/us/virtualization-consolidation.aspx" target="_blank">Hyper-V</a> and the forthcoming Windows Server <a title="SCVMM" href="http://www.microsoft.com/systemcenter/scvmm/default.mspx" target="_blank">Virtual Machine Manager</a>, both of which are part of Microsoftâ€™s <a title="Microsoft virtualization strategy" href="http://www.microsoft.com/virtualization/strategy.mspx" target="_blank">virtualization strategy</a>.

Available later this year.
