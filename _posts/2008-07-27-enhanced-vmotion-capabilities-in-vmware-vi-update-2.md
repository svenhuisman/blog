**Last week** <a href="http://www.vmware.com" target="_blank">VMWare</a> released the long expected Update 2 for the VMWare 3 Infrastructure products. Besides cool new features like Hot-cloning VM&#8217;s, W2K8 Guest support, Storage VMotion and VSS quiescing support, one of the <a href="http://www.vmware.com/support/vi3/doc/vi3_esx35u2_vc25u2_rel_notes.html#whatsnew" target="_blank">new features</a> is the so called **_EVC_**.

**This is introduced** as just another feature in the VMWare Infrastructure product line but this should not be taken lightly. EVCÂ stands for Enhanced VMotion Capability and it is a technology which <!--more-->can be used to add support to an existing VMotion cluster.

**This technique** uses the **_Intel FlexMigration_** and **_AMD-V Extended Migration_** techniques to make their CPU&#8217;s compatible with older CPU versions within your EVC cluster. You can enable EVC on a cluster in VirtualCenter wich then configures all hosts in the cluster to ensure CPU compatitbility for VMotion.
