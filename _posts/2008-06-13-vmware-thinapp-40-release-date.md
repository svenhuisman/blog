While I was working on an Application virtualization comparison chart (which will be released next week), I noticed something interesting. In the <a title="ThinApp FAQ" href="https://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/ThinAppFAQ.pdf" target="_blank">ThinApp FAQ</a> it is stated that the general availability of <a title="Vmware Thinapp" href="https://www.vmware.com/whatsnew/thinstall.html" target="_blank">VMware ThinApp</a> will be on **June 27th 2008**. So now you know.

Another thing I&#8217;ve read was this:

> _&#8230;it has a very fast product release cycle—about once a month._

This comes from the ThinApp whitepaper. I hope this also means that new features, like a GUI for editing applications, will be released soon. Fortunately, you don&#8217;t have to upgrade all your applications when a new ThinApp update is released.

Until the final release, you can read my review <a title="ThinApp review" href="https://svenhuisman.com/?p=28" target="_self">here</a>.
