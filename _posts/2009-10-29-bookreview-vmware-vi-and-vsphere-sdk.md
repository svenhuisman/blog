The author of the book <a title="VMware VI and vSphere SDK" href="http://www.amazon.com/VMware-VI-SDK-Mastering-Infrastructure/dp/0137153635" target="_blank">VMware VI and vSphere SDK</a> Â is Steve Jin, a senior member of technical staff at VMware, wrote this book to help the reader understand the VMware SDK and how to effectively use the SDK.

According to Steve Jin, this book is an indispensable resource for all:<!--more-->

  * VMware developers and administrators who want to get more done in less time;
  * for hardware vendors who want to integrate their products with VMware;
  * for ISV developers building new VMware applications;
  * and for every professional and student seeking a deeper mastery of virtualization.

This book takes a pragmatic approach to show you how to program or script VI SDK for your work. It has a lot of samples that you can use or alter to your own needs.

I&#8217;m no programmer or scripter, but even for me as a technical consultant this book can be very useful. I can imagine a customer with a specific need or a specific problem which can be solved with a custom build application or tool. With the help of this book, I have an idea about what is possible with the SDK and I can then advise the customer about how the problem can be solved. Bear in mind, If you want to build your own applications with the VI SDK, a prerequisite is to have basic Java programming skills. Most of the code samples in the book are written in Java.
