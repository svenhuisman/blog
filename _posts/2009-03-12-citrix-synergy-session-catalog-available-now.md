This year Virtualfuture.info will attend the <a title="Citrix Synergy Website" href="http://www.citrixsynergy.com" target="_blank">Citrix Syngery</a> event. This is a combination of 4 events (Citrix 2009 Iforum, Geek Speak Live, Virtualization Congress 2009, Network World Live). There will be a large number of virtualization experts attending a lot of different sessions. The red line through all sessions will be &#8220;Cloud Computing&#8221; and a lot of interesting peolple including Mark Templeton and Tom Flink will share their thoughts. We will try to attend as many cool sessions as we can and keep you up-to-date with the latest developments. The (somewhat complex) <a title="Synergy agenda" href="http://citrix.g2planet.com/synergy2009/event_agenda.php?date=2009-05-05" target="_blank">catalog of the sessions</a> is available online NOW! Hope to meet you there&#8230;
