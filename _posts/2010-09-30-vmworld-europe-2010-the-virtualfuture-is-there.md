For me, going to VMworld was a must because of the following:

A) **Networking** (meeting new people, keeping in touch with other virtualization enthousiasts)

B) **Discovering new products**. My company is constantly looking for new solutions and vendors in virtualization space and where better to find and talk to all of them at the same place: the Solutions Exchange of VMworld !

C) **Updating** my technical and sales **skills** around (desktop) virtualization products.

But besides that the event is stuffed with great Labs, Breakout Sessions, Super Sessions, A VMware Partner Track and much much more!<!--more-->

I’m really looking forward to the sessions covering VMware View 4.5 and Windows 7 best practices,  sessions about VDI in the SMB segment (small environments/local storage instead of SAN storage) and sessions about how create a real ROI/TCO calculation/Business Case for Desktop Virtualization.

And of course I have to admit that <a href="https://www.visitcopenhagen.com/" target="_blank">Copenhagen</a> itself drew my attention; I allways wanted to go there sometime.

I know are there are loads of known Dutch bloggers and other community peeps going there and I already have more invites for parties then I can handle so socially I don’t have any worries :).
