Friday June 1st 2012 was the day of the <a href="http://vmug17.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">17th Belgium VMUG</a>, a special bloggers edition. It was a great day, full of interesting sessions:

  * RAID types and  alignment impact on VMware workloads &#8211; Erik Zandboer
  * Workshop “Designing a cloud infrastructure” &#8211; Duncan Epping & Lieven D&#8217;Hoore
  * “Beer and PowerCLI: you can&#8217;t live without them” &#8211; Luc Dekens
  * “HyperV v3.0 vs VMware vSphere 5” &#8211; Alex Muetstege & Erik Scholten (VMGuru)
  * “Troubleshooting VDI” – Sven Huisman
  * “VMware Health Check” &#8211; Gabrie van Zanten
  * “Busting a few myths” &#8211; Eric Sloof
  * “Mobile devices and Cloud. Bring &#8217;em on” &#8211; Albert Kramer (Trend Micro)
  * “VCE” – Cisco, EMC & Trend Micro

  * “Unleash the IAAS Cloud: About VMware vCloud Director and more&#8230;”” &#8211; Viktor van den Berg
  * “vCenter Orchestrator” &#8211; Arnim Van Lieshout

I was honored to be invited to this event to speak about <a href="http://prezi.com/cnkrbuychyrb/vmware-view-troubleshooting/" target="_blank">VMware View troubleshooting</a>. As I had only 30 minutes, I didn’t do a deep dive session, but more of an overview of the VMware View components, what kind of problems you might run in to and a little bit deep diving troubleshooting the display quality using the <a href="http://mindfluxinc.net/?p=195" target="_blank">PCoIP Logviewer</a>.  It was my first time I presented in English and also the first time I used Prezi. But I think I did ok<img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-style: none;" src="https://svenhuisman.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/wlEmoticon-smile.png" alt="Smile" /> .

Now that I think about it, in a lot of sessions, free tools were mentioned which you can use in your day-to-day work as an virtualization administrator. For example tools to align your disks (<a href="http://nickapedia.com/2011/11/03/straighten-up-with-a-new-uber-tool-presenting-uberalign/" target="_blank">uberalign</a>), to automate tasks (<a href="http://www.vmware.com/go/PowerCLI" target="_blank">PowerCLI</a>), to troublshoot PCoIP (<a href="http://mindfluxinc.net/?p=195" target="_blank">PCoIP Logviewer</a>) or to automate workflows (<a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/vcenter-orchestrator/overview.html" target="_blank">vCenter Orchestrator</a>, comes with vCenter). And there was also free beer! In fact, the entire event was for free!

As a special surprise, <a href="http://www.veeam.com" target="_blank">Veeam</a> told us what is <a href="http://go.veeam.com/awesome.html?ad=large" target="_blank">coming next monday</a>. I can’t tell you what it is yet, but I will update this post as soon as I am allowed to (maybe it has to do with something I mentioned earlier in this blogpost?!?).

Update: Veeam announced <a title="VeeamZIP" href="http://www.veeam.com/virtual-machine-backup-solution-free.html" target="_blank">VeeamZIP </a>at the Belgium VMUG, a Veeam Backup Free Edition.

If you did not attend this Belgium VMUG event, I can really recommend to attend next time, because there were a lot of great sessions, great content, good conversations, it’s free, you can win prizes and there was Belgium beer!
