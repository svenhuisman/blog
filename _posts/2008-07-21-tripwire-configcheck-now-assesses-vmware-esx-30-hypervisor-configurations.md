<a title="Tripwire" href="http://www.Tripwire.com" target="_blank">Tripwire</a> updated their free ConfigCheck utility to assess the security and configuration of an ESX host. The previous version only supported ESX 3.5 and the updated version also checks ESX 3.0.

> _Tripwire ConfigCheck provides an immediate assessment of the configurations of a VMware ESX hypervisor, comparing them against VMware hardening security guidelines, which are best practice recommendations for optimal security in virtual environments, and provides remediation instructions if any are needed. With Tripwire ConfigCheck, customers gain immediate visibility into risks that might exist in their virtual environment due to misconfiguration and are advised of recommended fixes to any configuration settings that could present future risk._
