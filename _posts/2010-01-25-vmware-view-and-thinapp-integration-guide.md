Aaron Black from VMware posted a <a title="VMware View and ThinApp integration" href="http://blogs.vmware.com/files/vmware-ig-viewthinapp-en.pdf" target="_blank">VMware View and ThinApp Integration Guide</a> on his <a title="ThinApp blog" href="http://blogs.vmware.com/thinapp/2010/01/view-and-thinapp-integration-guide-part-3.html" target="_blank">blog</a>.

> _&#8220;The guide discusses several of the topics covered in the previous posts but brings it all together with some task based scenarios that walk you through initial setup and configuration with screenshots and sample scripts.&#8221;_

The guide should give answer to the following questions:

  1. Should I stream all my ThinApp packages from a fileshare or deploy them into the VMs?
  2. Where you I put my ThinApp packages? On the C:, the User Data Disk, a fileshare?
  3. How do I manage updates after the packages are in use?
  4. Will users keep their unique settings like toolbar buttons when running ThinApps from different desktops?
  5. How do I manage shortcuts and FileTypeAssociations for multi-user VMs?

It&#8217;s a straight-forward guide and it describes the different setup tasks between Persistent and non-persistent desktop.
