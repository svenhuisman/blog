As stated, automatic HA will be available out of the box. In another <a title="Road to Orlando" href="http://community.citrix.com/blogs/citrite/rogerkl/2008/07/24/The+Road+to+Orlando" target="_blank">blogpost</a>, they explain a little further about this new feature:

> _The built-in HA capability isn&#8217;t your only option, of course.  Our partners will continue to provide solutions that also incorporate application-level protection, replication, remote protection, policy-based management, true continuous availability, and more.  But there will be a powerful HA capability that will meet the business continuity needs of most IT organizations right in the box._

In this case, &#8220;our partners&#8221; is actually Marathon technologies, as I <a title="Xenserver-HA" href="https://svenhuisman.com/2008/07/marathon-xenserver-faulttoleranc/" target="_blank">wrote</a> a couple of weeks ago.
