Login VSI B.V. announces 4.0, a major new release of its flagship product Login VSI, the industry standard performance and scalability testing tool for Virtual Desktop Infrastructures and Server Based Computing environments.

The design of this new release has been driven by extensive customer feedback programs, and production testing projects executed at multiple customer and vendor sites, including the tests done for the acclaimed independent research <a title="Project VRC" href="http://www.ProjectVRC.com" target="_blank">project Virtual Reality Check</a>. Login VSI 4.0 makes testing of VDI and SBC environments easier and more realistic than ever before.

**Improved ease of installation**  
The test image footprint of Login VSI has been reduced by almost 90%. This makes the tool not only easier to install, but also easier to integrate and deploy. Centralization of management, updates and logging makes the use of Login VSI more efficient than ever. Direct Desktop Launch (DDL) mode enables large-scale testing with minimal infrastructure.

**Improved ease of test creation**  
The new intuitive and workflow oriented user interface of Login VSI 4.0 offers step-by-step test creation and wizard based test configuration for all important brokers and languages. The new workload editor introduces a new meta language which makes the customization of workloads very transparent and efficient. The new benchmarking mode enforces strict testing standards, providing industry standard results that are objective, comparable and repeatable.

**Improved test realism**  
The duration of the standard workloads has been increased from 14 to 48 minutes loops. Also the way in which segments and applications start has been improved to better reflect real world user behaviour. The datasets used in the workloads now offer 1000 different documents per type, more and larger websites, and a video library in every format, all to ensure a real world variety in data usage. The execution of the workloads is improved through the introduction of phasing, allowing for real world production user scenarios.<!--more-->

**Improved test insight**  
The new dashboard offers real-time test feedback, including progress, launched and active sessions, elapsed time and time left of the test in progress.

The industry standard index VSImax has been further refined, enriching scalability results (max number of users), with objective baseline performance results (independent of tested load). Automated reporting with out of the box report ready graphs for all used settings, response times, and other data enhances the level, and choice, of information generated by the Login VSI analyzer.

_“Login VSI is the industry standard for SBC and VDI testing and benchmarking, as is well demonstrated by the large number of technical papers that are available based on results from our benchmarking tool”_ says Eric-Jan van Leeuwen, CEO of Login VSI B.V. _“The ease of use, and improved realism, of this new release of Login VSI will enable both vendor and end-user organizations to build and protect well performing virtual desktop environments”._
