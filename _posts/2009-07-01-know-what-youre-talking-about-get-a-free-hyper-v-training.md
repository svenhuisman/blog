**<img class="alignleft" style="margin: 10px;" title="Hyper-V" src="http://confessionsandsarcasm.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/windows-server-2008-hyper-v-logo-v_2.png" alt="" width="142" height="63" />A**s a technical consultant and VMware enthousiast I&#8217;m very often evangalizing the power and beauty of VMware and it&#8217;s products but I also have to face it that Microsoft&#8217;s share in the Hardware Virtualization space is growing. I have to know what I&#8217;m talking about when suggesting that VMware has the best solution for a customer ;).

**T**hat (and probably the fact that I&#8217;m a Dutch guy) is why I was pleased to see the post on the <a href="http://www.mvug.co.uk/blogs/" target="_blank">MVUG (Microsoft Virtualization User Group) blog</a> by Patrick Lownds. It states that Microsoft has released a free Hyper-V training. The training is available til 28-12-2009 but I&#8217;m not sure until when you can use the free code to register for the training so be quick :).

**T**he training contains :  
1. An overview of the Hyper-V technology  
2. Creating a virtual environment  
3. Deploying systems in a virtual environment  
4. Configuring high availability in a virtual environment  
5. Administering a virtual environment with SCVMM
