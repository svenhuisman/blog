**I** already wrote an articly last week concerning <a href="https://svenhuisman.com/2009/05/1-week-of-ga-of-vsphere-40-getting-started/" target="_blank">the 1st week of general availability of vSphere</a> and refered to Roy Mikes&#8217; article about installing ESX on VMware Workstation but now Xtravirt, known by their usefull PDF&#8217;s concerning these issues have released theirÂ howto &#8220;**_<a href="http://xtravirt.com/node/177" target="_blank">How to install ESX 4.0 on Workstation 6.5.2 as a VM</a>_**&#8220;. Their PDF, wich is behind closed doors (<a href="http://xtravirt.com/user/register" target="_blank">just register</a>, it&#8217;s free), also describes how to configure your ESX VM so that you can run nested VM&#8217;s.
